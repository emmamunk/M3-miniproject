The apartment is located just two or three minutes from the Odenplan T-bana subway stop which is three stops from Central Station. You can walk from her place to the old town of Gamla Stan in a short 25 minutes or easily catch the bus or T-bana from Odenplan. There are several nearby restaurants within a minute or two walk from her place.

The room and apartment were very comfortable, clean, and as described in the photos. Nina provided several guidebooks and pamphlets on Stockholm and has helpfully marked her favorite spots to see and places to eat. Nina was very friendly and a pleasure to talk to. I always enjoyed our conversations and hearing her perspective on things. She made me feel very welcome and was interested in how my stay was going. She was also very helpful in allowing me to do laundry, provided me with coffee and breakfast each morning, and let me keep my bags at her place for a late check-out. 

I can easily recommend Nina and her apartment if you're looking for a place to stay in Stockholm!"

"3",155685,25034290,2015-01-05,2853633,"Diego","Robert was a fantastic host: kind, easy going and we felt he really put an effort on us feeling at home: We arrived on New Year's Eve and he waited patiently for us and even bought us breakfast for the next morning.

His place is really beautiful: amazing views, wonderful light and its decorated with a lot of taste. We loved the location and everything we need was walking distance (grocery shops, restaurants, bakeries, ..). 

If we come back to Stockholm I hope we could stay there again."

Design aesthetic was very trendy as well. He was also very helpful with food suggestions. Hornstull is full of cafes, restaurants, and chic shops. There's even an underground grocery store / shopping mall really close. We'd stay here again without hesitation."

Je verblijft in een fijne (lokale!) buurt en het uitzicht is geweldig! Je kan veel lopend afleggen maar ook een metro pakken. De communicatie met Robert verliep vlot en prettig. 

Thank u so much Robert!"

The view from the apartment was incredible and the apartment itself gorgeously decorated. The apartment had everything we needed to be able to cook when we wanted. A fantastic stay all round!"
"8",155685,36038417,2015-06-24,908076,"Berk","We had a great stay at Robert's place. Though he couldn't be there to meet us (We'd arrived in the middle of the night), he made sure we had a smooth check-in and that everything was in order. All in all, he was a perfect host.

The location is great. The neighbourhood is lively and the apartment is close to the Hornstull T-Bana station and the bus stop where you can take the airport bus.

The apartment itself is decorated both aesthetically and functionally. We felt quite at home. I'd definitely recommend this place."

We really enjoyed our stay."

From the moment I arrived, I could feel very comfortable and as I listen music alot, the sound system was terrific for me. Robert's house view is stunning which I can say one of top views during my travel. the transport is also very close and other supermarkets and parks as well. I would like to stay here next summer again."

"12",155685,45997208,2015-09-07,16556399,"Håvard","The flat was nice and tidy, and the area was a cozy one with lots of cafes and places to visit. Robert was a friendly guy, and the books were interesting.

Two things that can be improved/informed about:

The curtains are very light, and for someone it can be difficult falling asleep, and there is a highway with continous traffic, if you're not used to it, it can be disturbing, so would be advisable to bring earplugs and a sleeping mask."

She was out of town for most of our stay but arranged to make everything go as smoothly as possible in her absence. Only hitch was the WIFI didn't work in our bedroom; we could only use it in the common area. No big deal though this was a great apartment for our needs!"

She offered us tea and coffee after we entered, and proceeded to provide us lots of detailed information on both Stockholm and the local area. We had everything we needed for the stay (hair dryer, towels, etc.)

A few guests were staying in the other rooms but it didn't seem too busy in terms of sharing the washroom or common spaces. Overall the apartment is quite large as it spans two floors.

The neighbourhood is very convenient for exploring Södermalm and is close to the Södra station for easy metro access. (We recommend trying pastries from nearby Fabrique!)"

Lidia provided towels and soap, shampoo, tea, and coffee. She was also a lovely host: when we arrived, she offered us coffee and tea and went over a map of Stockholm in her kitchen with us and pointed out the major sites. The apartment is well-located - steps from a major train station and near grocery stores. I would definitely  recommend it!"

There was a shared living space upstairs right outside our room where Lidia left tea making facilities etc. Location wide this is fantastic. Loads of public transport options extremely close by. Lots of places to eat, drink or look at some shops. And it was a very simple and short walk to the old town (about 20min I think) and then into the downtown area. Lidia was so helpful! When we arrived VERY late from the airport she stayed up to meet us and took the time to sit down with us, make a pot of tea, and discuss all the things we wanted to do while visiting. She gave us a map and helped us to know where everything was. Throughout our stay she was always helpful with ideas and even researched a lovely restaurant for us for brunch on Sunday!
It is worth noting that Lidia has two rooms that she rents out and these rooms share the one bathroom and the living space. Lidia bases herself downstairs. This wasn't an issue for us at all."

The location is great, in a beautiful, very calm alley in the center of the 'hip' area of Stockholm.  Public transport is available within a few minutes' walking distance.  Breakfast was rich and delicious, and provided us a good start into our days.

Her apartment in Sodermalm is very conveniently located and wonderfully quiet. Security is excellent and there's even a lift (elevator). Her apartment is quite spacious.  She offered us a lovely, healthy breakfast in a large kitchen, always nicely prepared and presented. The metro stop is a short walk, about 3 blocks away. We really enjoyed Sodermalm's restaurants, interesting old neighborhoods, great vintage shops, and of course the rest of Stockholm was delightful as well. Great little bakery called Tartan (Hornsgatan 32) about a 10 minute walk from Elisabeth's. Outstanding skateboard shop nearby, called Kalihula (I think). Really enjoyed Stockholm, 3 days wasn't nearly enough time."

Very homely, filled with different artworks and with a good bathroom and kitchen. Lovely area, close to the T-bana and busses so it is convenient to get almost anywhere! There are also grocery stores, cafes, restaurants etc. within a couple of minutes of the apartment. Satya is a great host; very relaxed and happy to talk or leave you to yourself. Very happy to have met him, we had some good conversations :) He was also nice enough to extend my stay a few days at short notice."

My room was facing a spacious and quiet courtyard. Free laundry machines and driers were available in the basement, and Fredric allowed me using the kitchen. The bathroom includes a small, half sized bath tub. It has been a very pleasant time. Fredric’s apartment is in one of the city’s nicest neighbourhoods and very close to Karolinska Insitutet’s Solna Campus, where I spend most time during this stay. As Fredric and I had different work schedules, we often only met briefly. Our interaction was always enjoyable, and Fredric created a great balance between allowing for personal space and offering a sociable atmosphere. Fredric helped me with all of my questions about how to do things in Sweden. I would be happy to stay there again anytime."

Very comfortable accommodations, with a nice common room for the guests. Highly recommended. I felt like home and enjoyed the city a lot. Thanks!

She provides great travel tips if you are visiting Stockholm as a tourist.  Her apartment is located in a convenient location, close to two metro lines.  There are a few rooms, like a small bed & breakfast.  I took the smallest room, which is perfect for a solo traveller.  There are also double rooms available.

It is a small room but it was perfect for me. There is also a common room with a little fridge that you can use. The air b&b is really close (2 min walk) to the train station (Stockholm Södra). That was perfect for my work, but it gets you in 2 min in Stockholm central. There are also several grocery shops closeby. When I stayed at Lydias place, several guest came and went. But everyone was very considerate to each other in sharing common place and bathroom and the atmosphere was really pleasant. Most of all, Lydia is very welcoming and very caring host! She had the patience also to have little Swedish conversations with me, and helping me in learning Swedish. When I arrived there was an internet connection problem, but she arranged immediately a way I could still have internet acces. She has also very good knowledge about the sight-seeing places in Stockholm and all the practical arrangments. No doubt I would recommend her and go back!"

It is quiet at night and I felt like coming home after long days walking around Stockholm. 
Having read previous reviews, I also decided to book breakfast which was a good idea.
It was my first airbnb-experience but hopefully not my last and should I come back to Stockholm, I am sure to try and stay with Lidia again. It is great to be able to travel this way as a 60+ person and also great to have a 60+ host as welcoming and interesting as Lidia. Thanks a lot, Lidia."

The room is small but very clean as is the entire apartment and bathroom.   There is a basic desk, nightstand and single bed.   The bathroom is shared with other guests.   

There were kids playing outside and I had to leave the window open for air so you can hear them playing but the neighborhood is very suburban and quiet with very few cars around.  It was very peaceful and serene.  

It is a 5-10 minute walk to any food or restaurant so there's no much immediately below the complex but the train is closely.

Lidia spent a lot of time to give me tips on where to go and what to see in Stockholm.  She answered all my questions and was a great host.  She looked after me with times that my train was leaving the next morning and provided anything I asked for (i.e. adapter)."

Lidia is an awesome host -  very welcoming and very helpful.  For instance on my last day I had to take a train to the airport and had gone out for a bit to check out the neighborhood. When I came back Lidia had a small slip of paper listing the available train times and the connecting bus times and the bus number that I would need.  On my first day Lidia helped me with sight seeing trips given my time constraints.  The room is quite comfortable for a single person and has a nice bed.  The bathroom is a shared one.

To begin with, Lidia was waiting at the front door to the building when I arrived despite only having an estimate for when I might be there.  She had tea and snacks waiting after I settled into my room and mapped out various spots in the city to explore.  Lidia was responsive without being intrusive and she even went out of her way to help me with laundry in the basement while I was out. In terms of the space, it was perfect for my quick stop in Stockholm, only a few blocks from the train to the airport and close to the action on Gotgagan street and in Old Town.   My room was clean along with the shared bathroom, and there was very little noise at night.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants an authentic Stockholm experience at a reasonable price. Thanks again Lidia."

No motorbike noises by night from the street  ( was very important to me.. ) One has really  everything for relaxing there. The area the apartment is located in is very close to the city center and has  very good access to the public transport. 
Lidia is an amazing host, she was very helpful and gave me a very detailed explanation of the way to her apartment,so I could get there very easily.
I must mention I still got free coffee,tee ect. even though I did not order breakfest !

It was about 5 minutes from the commuter train (handy for coming from main train station in Stockholm) and 10 to 15 minutes to the Metro (a bus stop was closer if you preferred.) It's also about 15 minutes to walk to SoFo, Stockholm's hipster area, if you like trendy restaurants etc. There is also a street that is closed to traffic that has fashion clothing stores like Gina Tricot (similar to H&M), about 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.

The room was small but cozy and comfortable. There are other rooms so you will meet other guests and hear their them in the shared common area but overall that wasn't an issue.

He even offered to drive us to get food since we arrived late. As for location, it is 30 minutes from the central station, further than I expected, but the metro station is a short walk away. Something to note is that it is located in the suburbs, so don't expect a lively neighborhood atmosphere. One thing that did confuse me though was the hefty cleaning fee I was charged, despite the fact that we were required to clean on the day of our departure. All in all, Ali's place served its purpose fine, but I would seek accommodation elsewhere next time I'm in Stockholm."

Södermalm is a nice area to stay in with lots of cafes, little shops and greenery all on the doorstep. It is also well connected which makes it easy to get to the center of the city.

Emma and her family were very attentive and made sure that we had a comfortable stay by checking with us if everything was going well and if we needed anything.

I can highly recommend the apartment to anyone wishing to visit Stockholm!"

We were there for 6 nights, and loved the neighborhood. The bus line stops right in front of the apartment, and the subway is a short walk. Sodermalm was a fun neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and coffee houses. Emma's apartment is located in a very quiet area, but only about 5 minutes from lots of restaurants and bars.

It was relatively easy to get to with very frequent bus service nearby. We appreciated the fun decor of the apartment and the nice little touches like the balcony overlooking the courtyard, extra charging cords for the electronics, and cool furniture. This would be an ideal place for a couple, a small group, or a family.

She was super welcoming and so kind. The apartment has plenty of space; didn't feel crammed with 4 of us. It was also clean, comfortable and super cute. The neighborhood is perfect; quiet, yet plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Not touristy at all, which we were hoping to avoid. Favorite restaurants were Gossip, Greasy Spoon and Urban Deli. All in all, awesome experience and I would stay again in a heartbeat."

Ausgewählt habe ich diese Unterkunft ursprünglich aufgrund der Beschreibung  \"Nature stay\". Und es stimmt. Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet ganz nahe an einem See und herrlich schöner Natur. 
Die Fahrt ins Zentrum ist unkompliziert, Metro-Station ist gleich um die Ecke. Auch die dort befindliche Einkaufsmöglichkeit ist praktisch.
Die Beschreibung war sehr genau und absolut zutreffend.
Linnéa selbst ist eine wunderbare Person und Gastgeberin, zu der man jederzeit mit Anliegen kommen kann, wenn etwas nicht passt - was aber nicht erforderlich war. Auch u.a. meine späte Abreise am letzten Tag war kein Thema. Deshalb:
Ein herzliches Dankeschön an Linnéa!

Vidhatri and her husband, Bala, are lovely warm people :) They helped us from the start before we came to Sweden, advising us on which tickets to buy at the airport and directions.
 
On arrival we were given homemade pancakes and waffles, and each morning we were given delicious homemade food at whatever time we woke up. We especially loved our Indian breakfast! Their daughter helped us decide which places to visit, and we were made to feel so welcome it felt like home.

The room is large and spacious – definitely big enough for two people – and the bed is so comfortable! Metro is a 2 minute walk away, and the all night metros at the weekend made this a convenient place close to the centre, but also quiet enough to get a good night’s sleep. The room is exactly as the description says. 

Thank you so much for having us! We loved Sweden and hope to see you again soon. Would definitely stay here again and recommend."

You really could not ask for a better location, easy access to the metro and grocery store coupled with the best nature you could imagine just a short walk away with cows, horses, pigs, goats, hills, and beautiful pastures. But thats not even the main reason I would advise staying at this location. Vidhatri and her family are very amazing people. They were very kind to us throughout our entire stay and extremely helpful when it came to providing directios and advice. They also make very delicious indian food which was always a plus. If you do not like eating vegetarian or do not enjoy exploring other cultures then this may not be the place for you. We however are very fond of learning and experiencimg different cultures so this was great for us. Additionally, everyone in this family seemed to wake up early in the morning, which would make sense since the sun rises at 4 am in Sweden. So it helps if you also prefer to rise early in the morning. Overall we really enjoyed staying in Sweden and being emersed in nature which this location provides."

We kept meeting little notes here and there, which explained everything we needed to know about the apartment, Stockholm, Sweden and the whole world. Well, kidding about the last one, but, really, the lore was comprehending, we will now check out the bookstores for his Stockholm Guide, so much worthy his guidelines about life in Södermalm's region are. I skip the delicate part of how flexible he is as a host about various aspects any traveler might want to flex. And being most generous towards our egotistic manners was just one more precious quality of him, amidst whole a lot. Besides, we learned a couple tricks, which let us enter civilized society from now on,  so no more leaving the key under the floor mat, after all. Stockholm in Daniel's edition is great, what more can I say?"

Daniel was so fast at answering our request to stay in the apartment, our questions in advance and messages while we were in the apartment. Such a nice, funny and good guy.

The apartment is brilliantly layed out and decorated. So cleverly done and bigger than I thought from the photo. Other then that it looks exactly as the photos. Clean and cosy made us feel at home right away. Real character. BIG nice TV and a threat to have Netflix :) Nice soft bed.

The location is PERFECT. I twisted my ankle the week before we went, so it was so good to be able to quickly get back home for a little rest before going out again for more experiences. Lots of nice shops in the neighbourhood, very short to the subway/bus etc. and very good to have the opportunity to go outside on the balcony.

A few nights we stayed in a prepare meals in the wonderful kitchen and ate in the dining room with candles.

The area is also really nice, with plenty of bars, coffee shops and the metro is a 2 minute walk away, and only about 5 minutes to central Stockholm. There is also a convenience store just around the corner.

Rummet var mycket litet, men tillräckligt stort för att göra studier med ett bra skrivbord och en bekväm stol. Något som bör tänkas på dock för andra resenärer som t.ex. behöver arbetsro är att barnen i huset ibland kan vara högljudda (även om de är jättesnälla). Rummet har heller inte några fönster (vilket ses på bilderna), vilket bör uppmärksammas för den som vill se dagsljus ofta. För min del fungerade det dock bra eftersom jag ändå kom hem under kvällen oftast när det var mörkt ute. Sängen var bekväm och man sov gott i rummet.

Huset ligger inom bra avstånd till tunnelbanan och billigare mataffärer nära Hagsätra centrum.

Boendet rekommenderas till den som vill ha ett boende inom fungerande pendlingsavstånd till Stockholm centrum, en trevlig värd och ett stort skrivbord för arbete (men med beaktande av att det finns barn i huset)."

We had a 1 year old with us who had no problems settling into the house. All the essentials was provided for. We had movie nights in when it was rainy with a good selection of movies. I would recommend Malin's home, lovely, clean, spacious and in a very convenient location."

We did not spend that much time at her house as we loved spending time in Stockholm. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood, but is very well connected to Stockholm by public transportation. We walked to the bus station which is right down the street and took the bus to the metro station (Svedmyra). Alternatively, we could have walked to the metro station. 
We did not meet Marlin in person as she was away on a business trip, but she let us stay at her house at very short notice. She was very friendly in the email and phone communication and we are sure that it would have been a pleasure to meet her in person. The communication with her was very easy. 
The house is wonderful. It is exactly like described by Malin and shown in the pictures. We only used the kitchen for making breakfast as we ate at different restaurants in Stockholm. We stayed the bedroom with a double bed. It is a large king-size bed and extremely comfortable. As it is so quiet in the neighbourhood, we slept very well.

The house is located in a very green suburb - it's almost like being in a forest and we saw a deer and fawn from the kitchen window one morning. However, it is also very convenient within 10 mins walk of the metro and a great supermarket. 
The weather in Stockholm was hot so it was ideal to return from the city centre to relax in the bright, spacious house and garden. All in all, a very comfortable, well-equipped house to stay in."

Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Vorort von Stockholm. Die Blicke aus den Fenstern gehen ins Grüne, was sehr angenem ist.

Die Wohnung war bei der Übernahme sehr verschmutzt (am Boden war Lurch, Betten, insbesondere Matratzen, dicke Staubschicht auf den Möbeln und Sesseln, Geschirr etc.). Ein Raum konnte wegen der extremen Verschmutzung der Betten nicht benützt werden, daher wurden Matratzenauflagen verwendet um ein \"Bett\" am Boden des Wohnzimmers zu schaffen. Man hatte subjektiv den Eindruck die Bettwäsche eines Bettes wurde nach dem Vorbenützer nicht gewechselt. Wir hatten vorher noch nie eine derart verschmutzt Unterkunft erlebt. Bei der Anwesenheit von Herrn Wigardt gleich beim Einzug war das Ausmaß der Verunreinigung noch nicht abzusehen, wir waren sozusagen überrumpelt.

Sköndal is a suburb of Stockholm with a shopping centre two minutes walk from the apartment that has a supermarket, bank, chemist, newsagent and restaurant. The bus stop is about 7 minutes walk and buses run into Stockholm every two or three minutes. It takes ten minutes bus ride to get to Gullmarsplan metro station and then from there the metro goes all over Stockholm. From the flat to the very centre of Gamla Stan takes half an hour at the most.

The room itself is very clean and nice to stay at. A few minutes walking from the house you have the centre of Sköndal where you have a supermarket and a bus going to a big Metro station that leads you to the city.

We got space in the fridge and were able to use the kitchen for home cooked meals. The city center and Old Town were easy to reach with the bus that stops three minutes from her place.

We arrived late from the airport and Margareta kindly drove us from Stockholm center to her accommodation. It roughly took 15 minutes by car but you are already in place full of nature, peaceful and close-by a swimmable lake. By the public transportation which is highly efficient (bus + subway), the same track takes 30min maximum.

Margareta's accommodation itself is a pretty big apartment, clean and tidy. You are hosted in a really conformtable room, have a private bathroom and access to the balcony where you can enjoy a peaceful breakfast surrounded by flowers. The apartment is located 2min by walk from a supermarket and the bus station. It is also well placed for outside activities lovers. It is the best Airbnb we experienced so far.

Even more than the accommodation, we highly appreciated our hosts. Margereta is a clever woman, joyful and interesting.  She helped us to carry our apartment research and discover Sweden and Swedish. We also had fun with anthon & Julia, her two smart and well-educated children. They make our staying even more appreciable!

The house is exactly the same as the photos shown and the room is really spacious and cozy, the balcony is full of flowers, decorated beautifully. Margareta arranged the cleaning for every two weeks to keep the room and the private toilet clean. The two kids are really kind and every time when I ask them for help, they are always willing to help. It takes like 25-30 mins to the city centre with transport of bus + metro. One thing concerns me is the bus sometimes runs only two times every hour on Sunday. So that it is  really important to check the schedule carefully. But that is only on Sunday. From Monday to Friday, every morning I go to work, the bus runs so frequently in the peak hour (ard 7-9 am). Overall, it is a really good place to stay! I definitely recommend this house."

Everything within walking distance. The interior is really nice, it is spacious, light, has a beautiful balcony, fully equipped kitchen, wifi and was very clean. And the bed! It has a really good bed!
Contact with Marie-Louise went very smooth, before our arrival, when we arrived, during our stay and when we left. She is really nice, kind and helpful.
We had a very good time in the apartment. Highly recommended and definitely first choice for our next visit to Stockholm.

The apartment is a great space with a lovely little balcony off of the kitchen and very convenient to a grocery store and a metro stop. It was also very walkable to the city center, if one preferred to walk rather then take public transport. It was a great place to stay with and the only small downside was it was a tiny bit noisy on Friday and Saturday night, but we had the windows open as Stockholm was warm for our first few days. I would not hesitate to stay here again."

Frederik was there to welcome us upon arrival, and introduced us to the apartment, the neighborhood and made some great recommendations on things to do/see in Stockholm. The apartment is clean, bright, and very spacious! We especially enjoyed the balcony! The location of the apartment is unbeatable - very close to the T, and a short walk to several bus stops. There's a supermarket and a bakery  just around the corner (and lots of restaurants, too!)  and therefore it is very convenient to get ingredients to put a meal together! The best way to experience life as a Stockholmer! Highly recommend!"

All of our questions were easily and promptly answered by email before we arrived, and Magnus met us at the apartment when we arrived and showed us all around. The apartment itself is very spacious, light-filled, clean, and cheerful. It has beautiful wood floors, a good size and well-equipped, easy to use kitchen, and one powder room and one small full bath with tub and shower. We only used the master bedroom, which has a king size very comfortable and firm bed and black out shades, which was nice as it was nearly midsummer and very light at night! There is also another bedroom for children. The apartment is really quiet, with no street noise or noise from other apartments. The area of the city is friendly, safe, and great for walking, with lots of trees, flowers, and birds. There is a lovely park five minutes away. Markets and restaurants are easy to find nearby. It was a very pleasant 20 minute walk into the central areas, depending where one was going. The metro is only a two minute walk and is very fast, frequent, and clean and goes anywhere one is likely to want to go. We really liked the neighborhood and found it the perfect location for seeing Stockholm and taking day trips. Magnus was a great host and we had a perfect stay. Thank you!"

His apartment was just as it was advertised, a family friendly, comfortable and clean home, with a good kitchen, a nice dining area, a large and comfotable living room and 2 bedrooms.  The building is a nice pre-war structure with elevators and automatic doors plus a trash shute on each floor. It is situated in a very friendly and safe neigborhood just outside of downtown (you can even walk downtown if you are not in a hurry). The T station is literatlly 4 minutes walking by foot, meaning that you can be downtown in less than 20 minutes door to door. The nighborhood has a small supermarket that is open from 0700AM till 1100 PM as well as a few restaurants (we enjoyed the Sushi). In Short, this apartment has a lot going for it: a wonderful, helpful and friendly host, a wonderful place to stay a week as a family, and a good location. We will be more than happy to come here again!"

I confidently recommend you this apartment house where you can fully enjoy an extremely comfortable and convenient garden city life. Magnus is a host who provides kind communication in time with his guest in perfect English. He lives in neighborhood and provides services in accordance with guest’s request.

The subway station Gärdet is located in a quiet residential area surrounded by rich greeneries while its access from Stockholm Central Station is very convenient with taking only 6 minutes. It takes only 3 minutes on foot from a ground exit where you can directly ascend by a lift from ticket gates of the station Gärdet. A supermarket located beside the exit offers perfect items in a reasonable price, which is extremely convenient. 

You can also reach a bus stop for No.54 bus in a 4-minute-walk on a downhill footpath in the forest to the west. I fully recommend a cozy Thai restaurant located on the way because its great taste, quality and reasonable price.

A wide living and dining room, the main bedroom with a queen size bed, another bedroom with bunk beds, an easy-to-use kitchen kept tidy and in order, a bathroom with an sufficiently wide bathtub and toilet and another lavatory are well equipped. All windows consist double glasses and you can enjoy a tea time in the balcony."

This was a smooth process because the apartment block was centrally located, just a short 30–35 minutes cab ride from the airport. Paolo informed me earlier that he will not be around for the check-in but using the GlueLock app to get in was a breeze.

APARTMENT
The space was exactly as pictured/described, but a lot prettier. It seems Paolo has just completed a few new pieces of art and they were displayed in the apartment – lovely pops of colour. The kitchen was also very well stocked and Paolo generously invited me to help myself to anything I might need. 

The bed seems to be a double but it's really good for one person; it would be snug for two (as the listing suggested). But Paolo included an extra mattress in case it was necessary. While I didn't set it up, there was more than enough room to set up the extra bed. The bathroom was clean and fresh towels were provided. A small blowdryer was also provided.

LOCATION
It was my first visit to Stockholm and I have not stayed anywhere else in the city. But I cannot imagine a more central location to stay and explore the city. There is a supermarket a block away and the main Götgatan street is less than 2 minutes walk away. While it was very central, the street where Paolo's apartment is on is rather quiet. There were occasional loud conversations from the street but this was only because I left one of the windows open.

Several of the city's popular bakeries, cafes and restaurants were a short walk away – Cafe String, Pom & Flora, Bakvervet, Bagerie Petrus, Gondolen, Nook, Nytorget 6 and more. It also took me less than 30 minutes to walk to Gamla Stan.

I highly recommend Paolo's apartment if you're in the city for a few days and looking to explore the vibrant Södermalm neighbourhood on foot, and even Gamla Stan. It was in a great location and Paolo made the stay extra welcoming with his warm messages and quick replies."

It doesn't feel cluttered at all just well-curated and thoughtfully chosen. By the end of our stay, I wanted to sit down and ask Cecilia about her travels and interests. I love light and air and the two balconies - one of the kitchen and one of the dining area - were perfect. Everything is clean and well-organized. Communication with Cecilia was quick and easy. The flat is in a great location with tube stop, grocery stores, an excellent cafe, and a vegetarian restaurant steps away. It was also easy access to Slussen and Gamla Stan.

"405",536691,41922592,2015-08-10,16591965,"Sharon","Cecelia's place was clean and had many eclectic artsy decor.  There's two charming balcony located in the kitchen area and the formal dining room.  Her place is conveniently located in the Sodermalm area which is around 10-15 minute walk to Gamla Stan and Central Station.  There are many great little cafes, restaurants, and hipster type of bars close to Cecelia's place.  With the windows open at night the place had a nice breeze therefore we were always comfortable and had some pleasant sleep.  Her place was equipped with all the extra amenities if you desire to cook.
We usually made breakfast and had dinner out since there's too many great restaurants to pass up on.  Stockholm is a great walking city and Cecilia's flat was greatly enjoyable.
The only recommendation is to squat while you shower since there's no shower curtain and the water will splatter everywhere making it rather messy and wet in the bathroom. Other than that it's a wonderful flat with the best possible location."

He received us when we arrived in Stockholm and showed us around the apartment, provided towels and bed linen as well as some nice bubbly wine to welcome us! He was also available via phone during our stay and gave us some tips for the Hornstull area. His flat is very central and close to the subway, the area has a lot of restaurants and is close to various shops. The flat has a really original and scandinavian style, we liked it so much! I would strongly recommend Anton and his flat for a Stockholm stay. :)  Thanks so much for having us!"

The pictures on airbnb don't seem to do it justice. On entering the house we knew that we were home. The house is very spacious and has so much character. Patrik was kind enough to map out where we can find the groceries, bakery and even the perfect spot for a morning jog. The four of us slept very well at night, and having 2 bathrooms meant that we never had to wait to take a shower or use the facilities. The neighbours are very friendly and helpful, they even told us how to get to the river bank which is literally 3mins walk away from the house. I cannot fault the house at all,however, our only regret was that we didn’t get the chance to meet Patrik and the family to thank them in person for allowing us to stay in their lovely house, especially when we were finding it very difficult to find accommodation on airbnb. Hats off to Patrik and family for being the PERFECT! hosts."

The kitchen and dining area are spacious, and well stocked with cooking equipment, large oven, and a beautiful view. The neighborhood is charming and I liked the fact that we were in a quiet area, but with quick access to the city.  We were able to get to the train station with a lovely 15 minute  walk along the water or by tram. We had breakfast every morning at the local bakery at the bottom of the hill.

Edwin is a nice guy, and he knows English pretty well.
The house is pretty close to metro station (1 min walking), you can take the train there and go to city center in less than 10 minutes.

You can use the kitchen utensils (as long as you wash them afterwards), and cook your own food.

On my next visit to Stockholm, hopefully i will stay in the same house."

This was my first experience with Airb&b and it was excellent.  VERY EASY.  Edwin and his wife are VERY clean.  The bed is EXCELLENT.  Absolutely no problems.

My highest recommendation.  Value for money is EXCELLENT!  (How will hotels survive AirB&B?)"

Huone oli erittäin puhdas ja kuvat vastaavat täysin todellisuutta. Edwin antoi meidän käyttää keittiötä aamupalojen ja välipalojen tekemiseen, myös jääkaappi oli meidän käytössä. Asunto sijaitsee Tukholman paremmalla alueella ja siellä oli täysin turvallista liikkua. Asunto on helppo löytää koska se sijaitsee aivan Karlaplanin metroaseman yläpuolella. Edwinin sai helposti kiinni emaililla ja hän oli oikein mukava.

In English:
The room was clean and exactly as it is in photos. We were allowed to use the kitchen and the fridge for breakfeast and small snacks. Edwin´s apartment is located in Stocholm's highend area. Apartment is very easy to reach with subway because it is located on top of the Karlaplan metro station. The area is safe and very close to most of the tourist attractions. Communication was very easy with Edwin and he was really nice to us."

Even though we did not request it, our bed sheets and bath towels were changed after the first four days. We had easy access to the kitchen in the morning, and the fact that there is only one bathroom in the whole apartment turned out not to be  an issue.
Edwin and Ladiya are extremely gracious hosts, and Edwin's directions to find the apartment are flawless. The apartment is on the 4th floor of a very well located building. The Karlaplan metro station is right below the building. Once you exit the metro station you find yourself in a shopping center with two large supermarkets, a variety of shops, restaurants, and pharmacies. Shops close at 18:00 hrs and the supermarkets at 22:00 hrs.
We did all our touring on foot, because the apartment is only about ten minutes away from Strandvagen.

Best of all was that it was conveniently located near buses, subway station, and a nice supermarket.  The room was a little small with no desk, but if you are out most of the time and only sleep, eat, and shower there it won't be an issue.

Edwin offered some great suggestions and went above and beyond when I had questions or needed some help. This apartment is in the lovely Ostermalm neighborhood, which is a really beautiful place where a lot of locals live. Plenty of shopping, grocery, and some great restaurants nearby, not to mention that central Stockholm and all of the tourist sites are an easy 15 minute walk away. The Karlaplan metro stop is literally just downstairs as well, which made getting to/from the central station a simple 5 minute train ride.  If you stay here, I'd also recommend checking out the local cafe/restaurant called Broms, which is just around the corner. Excellent food and drinks!

The neighborhood was lovely and right near many shops and restaurants; a two block walk led to a beautiful park with fountains and statue of Strindberg. As many reviewers have noted, the shower arrangement in the bathroom is a bit weird, but workable if you don't mind squeegeeing the floor after your shower. I found the very soft, thin mattress very uncomfortable because it offered no back support, but my husband slept just fine. There was instant coffee and tea in the kitchenette, but with terrific cafes so near, we didn't use either. There was a hairdryer provided too, but there was no place to plug it in in the bathroom (and the mirror in there was too high for me to see myself anyway); it could have been plugged in the kitchen, but that had no mirror either. So I ended up drying my hair at the desk in the picture, using the mirror that was about 16 feet away - not a good setup. I'd recommend this accommodation for someone with a good back who doesn't have to use a mirror much."

Karl welcomed us and showed us into the flat, which is next door to his own and proceeded to give us some useful tips about Stockholm in the general and the local area in particular. There is a host of eating and drinking establishments close to the flat and the T-Bana (metro) station was about 2 minutes walk away. Its an ideal location from which to explore the city.
The flat itself is comfortable and remarkable ingenuity has been shown in fitting a shower and kitchen space into the confines of an historic building!"

To the previous comments, I would add my particular appreciation for the approach to this apartment dating back to 1884 -- either via open cage elevator, or via stone stairs that curve gracefully around it, lighted by windows from an interior courtyard.  The separate entrance from the hallway, shielded by both inner and outer doors, makes me guess this space was once servants' quarters.  The building is located one block from August Strindberg's last residence, and a stay here is like stepping onto the set of one of his plays, or Ibsen's, or Ingmar Bergman's \"Fanny and Alexander.\"  How many times can you do that?"

Da am Tag unserer Ankunft mein Geburtstag war, hatte er uns zwei kleine Flaschen Sekt und etwas schwedischen Kaviar als kleine Aufmerksamkeit organisiert. Das Zimmer selbst ist klein, erfüllt aber seinen Zweck. Das Bett ist weich und bequem, jedoch nichts für Personen die gerne eine harte Matratze mögen. Der kleine TV hat ca 8 Programme, ist jedoch nebensächlich denn Stockholm ist viel zu schön als das man sich mit TV schauen begnügen müsste. Es gibt eine kleine Schrankwand für Klamotten und auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite zwei Herdplatten und einen kleinen Kühlschrank sowie eine Kaffeemaschine (nichts spektakuläres aber es erfüllt alles seinen Zweck). Das Bad ist ebenfalls sehr klein, beim duschen überschwemmt man leider (trotz \"Schutzvorrichtung\") den kleinen Raum, kann den Boden aber mit einem Wischer trocknen. Alles in allem war es sauber. Da man zwei Holztüren zwischen sich und dem Treppenhaus hat, ist er relativ ruhig. Leider konnten wir nicht aus dem Fenster schauen, da das Haus derzeit saniert wird, ansonsten hat es aber keinerlei Einschränkungen gegeben. Die Lage der Wohnung ist top. Man hat in fünf Minuten zu Fuß viele Restaurants und den Beginn der Fußgängerzone. Nach Gamla Stan läuft man ca 15-18 Minuten."

The apartment has a very good location - just next to the metro but really you can reach almost all tourist attraction on foot and Stockholm worth it for sure. Apartment is small but cozy. There is a reparation in the building as it is 18th century and window was covered with the paper - but I was coming to the room only to sleep so ho problems. Would definitely come back again!"

The room/apartment was much better than I expected and was perfect for my intentions: have a place to crash at night. 
The shower is mini, but it is OK, although it is uncomfortable to drain the water after each shower. 
Everything else great: the bed, the kitchenette, the bathroom, there was even a TV! Perfectly located.

Karl non ha tradito le aspettative e si è dimostrato molto gentile e disponibile. Siamo arrivati a Stoccolma verso mezzanotte e mezza, da T Central basta percorrere 10 minuti a piedi Drottningattan, la via pedonale dello shopping, e si arriva all'appartamento. Karl ci ha accolti mostrandoci l'appartamento e ci ha consigliato cosa vedere a Stoccolma.
Sapevamo che a Stoccolma gli spazi abitativi sono molto piccoli, ma daltronde l'alloggio serve per dormire e usare il bagno. Il letto è a una piazza e mezza abbondante, comodo. Il cucinino ha un fornello elettrico e un forno a microonde, adatto per prepararsi una colazione veloce (noi l'abbiamo usufruito solo per bere un the). A disposizione degli ospiti si trova caffè solubile, the, e vettovaglie per prima colazione.
Il bagno è pulito. Unica nota dolente: manca un vero e proprio piatto doccia (una volta lavati bisogna asciugare, il pavimento però rende l'operazione veloce e semplice). A disposizione degli ospiti la WI-FI.
Nel complesso possiamo dire che l'appartamento è perfetto per una breve vacanza e Karl è super disponibile ad aiutare gli ospiti per ogni loro richiesta.

Karl is very friendly and helpful. We arrived in Stockholm at half past midnight, from T Central just walk 10 minutes on Drottningattan street, one of main pedestrian shopping street.
Karl met us showing us the apartment. He tell us some information about Stockholm.
In Stockholm living spaces are very small. The bed is comfortable. The kitchen has an electric cooker and a microwave oven, suitable to prepare a quick breakfast (we benefited only to drink a cup of tea). Guests will find instant coffee, tea, and provisions for breakfast.
The bathroom is clean, but there isn't a shower box, so after shower you have to dry it. By the way this operation is fast and simple.
Free WI-FI is included.
The apartment is perfect for a short break and Karl is super helpful to assist guests with their every request."

The room was smaller then it looked on the pictures but was an ok size, the kitchen was tiny and did not have any running water (taps) and wouldn't really suffice as a kitchen had we needed to cook anything.

The bathroom again was ok, small the downside was the shower - Karl mentioned he was trying to get permission to change the draining. 
The shower is a temporary add on and extremely cramped - also floods the whole bathroom.

Location of this flat is brilliant, extremely central and easily walk able to a lot of main tourist destinations."

"549",608672,56181556,2015-12-10,14768801,"Lorri And Bill","Karl's pre trip communication helpful as was when he provided a key to the flat  He also provided some insight/recommendations for places to see and eat. The location is pretty good;  10 minutes from bus or train stations,  near shopping,  old city,  ferries are all 20 to 30 minutes away by foot. 
The place is very, very basic. 
The only issue was the bathroom. The place was built in the late 1890s or so so there are limits to any renovation you can do. The place is an \"apartment\" only because it has a separate entry way from the main suite (the doors to the main suite in the place still exist) to the main foyer entry.   It is a one room--former bedroom-- place with a two piece bath and a poorly designed third piece as a \"shower\"  which is not enclosed in the bathroom. This is not uncommon however the bathroom floor ends up with water standing on the floor as the drain top sits above the floor/water level. These means you need to squeegee the water off the floor and into the drain every time you shower or you step in water every time you go into the bathroom. 
The closet hasthe coffee maker, 2 burner hot plate,  microwave and small refrigerator one on top of another. While convenient on one hand,  could be dangerous in another. 
Despite these items, it is an acceptable place for one person. I, personally, would not have 2 persons here due to the limited space available."

All the essentials are there for a comfortable accommodation including excellent wi-fi internet for checking on touring arrangements and keeping in touch with home. We did eat breakfasts and light dinners in the apartment. The kitchen was suitably equipped. We did eat our main meal at lunch to take advantage of the hearty lunch specials offered by many restaurants at reasonable prices. The location was also excellent for our needs. Nearby are many restaurants, cafes, and a large supermarket. However, the location is just far enough away to provide a quiet environment with Stockholm residents. The apartment was also very quiet. We walked to all the attractions in and near “Old Town” and used the water ferry to reach others, such as the Vasa Museum. Public transportation is also nearby as well as taxi service, which we should have used after a long day touring. Lina was very helpful before the departure, and she met us at the apartment and provided helpful suggestions and information. She was also available if we had questions, etc. She did help with a phone calling problem and taxi service to the airport.

We travelled with our two kids and the best part of the trip was without a doubt the kids' room, they neither wanted to exit to the street, only wanted to be playing.

We stayed with out 18 month old son, the bedroom he had was blacked out (important in mid summer) with lots of nice toys for him to play with too! 
The apartment is tastefully decorated, with a really comfy bed. And everything you need to make your stay run smoothly. And it's really clean and tidy.

The quarter is really cool, young, calm but also full of beauty small shops and place to eat (bakery, small supermarket). Underground station is just 2 minutes walking. Stockholm, generally speaking, seems always a safe city. 

The building is really good, the apartment is not big but the guest bedroom is really big (more then it looks like in photos). Interior design is warm modern swedish style (we liked it a lot). It's very clean and everything works well. The bedroom is full of light (and we liked it). For people who need total dark during the night, consider is not simply to totally avoid natural light during the night (in june day light is from 4am to 22pm) also shutting the curtains.

We were always out, so we did not live the apartment too much. For people who need privacy or want to stay a lot inside, must consider that to go to the kitchen it's necessary to pass through the living room where Mallika (only night time) sleeps in a curtain separated area.
This was not a big deal for us. 
Wi-fi works great.

We didn't use kitchen to prepare food but Mallika alway asked if we need it and explain how to use it. 
We always come back late, but no problem about noise for Mallika (of course we were not noisy..). 

The price is absolutely fair compared to Stockholm standard. In our experience we were surprised that Stockholm is cheaper then London or Paris."

The location is in a great part of town (sandwiched between two great coffee shops!) I had a couple of questions through out my stay and Mallika answered each one swiftly. Recommended!"

It's quiet and lovely, and the location is AMAZING--the very heart of Sodermalm.

Mallika was so easy to get in touch with and everything was just as we needed. Would stay again!"

The apartment is in an EXCELLENT location, in a fantastic neighborhood next to one of the best coffee shops I've ever been to. It is a very nice, short walk into Old Town and the rest of central Stockholm. And the neighborhood is surprisingly quiet at night such that sleeping with the windows open poses no problem. The only issue was that I was woken up when Mallika left the apartment early our first night of sleeping (around 3am) for travel; this made it very hard for me to get a good night's rest the first night, although my wife was able to sleep through it."

Her apartment is stunning - we were so happy to spend Christmas in such a beautiful place. The room was even bigger than it looks in pictures, with tons of natural light and a very comfortable bed. It was a great location - there were plenty of bars and restaurants right around us, and a grocery an easy walk away. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in the city. I would highly recommend staying in Mallika's beautiful home!"

We absolutely love what she did with the place; it's comfortable, very nicely decorated and homely. Furthermore, set in the vibrant Södermalm district of central Stockholm, the apartment is excellently located. Especially if you are looking for a place close to small, inviting boutiques, which focus on design and vintage, and good value places to eat that the locals themselves would frequent.
We will highly recommend it to our family & friends, and we are already looking forward to staying here again!"

Noor's place is truly her home and as such is comfortable and feels safe and warm. The layout is spacious with 1 huge \"king\" sized bed, two full sized beds, and a huge couch. The kitchen is well equipped, there are 1.5 bathrooms, ample towels and extra linens, and the apartment is bright and airy. Location is great in the center of Norrmalm. For folks looking to visit Stockholm, it really is a perfect location. One note - we eventually reset the wifi network extender because the service wasn't great. After the reset, everything worked perfectly. In the end, Noor's sister helped us save some money on a cab back to the airport, and capped off a great experience. Thank you, Noor and Soheer!"

When we arrived at the appartment she welcomed us and gave us the tour. The appartment is big, and there were no problem for us 4 staying there. 

The appartment was very clean, and all the beds were made before we arrived. Noor even placed some chocolates for us on the dinner-table. 

The location of the appartment is very good. Only a few minutes walking to Drottninggatan, which is the main street with many cafees and shops. If you wanna walk to the old town, it takes about 15-20 minutes.

The room is exactly as you see in the photo, simple, bright and clean.  The bathroom is also very clean.  My partner slept on a mattress on the floor as the bed is only a single bed but both of us were very comfortable and felt at ease in Alexandre's home.  The weekend we stayed Alexandre had his son over but both of them were very quiet.  Alexandre's home is an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest T-bana station, Skarpnack, and your ride will take you just over 15 minutes into Stockholm central.  Alexandre's home is definitely value for money as although you need to take a train into town, you will definitely not find as nice or clean of a hostel in the city center."

Neighbourhood is really nice too and Alex has a nice garden. Just to avoid confusion, maybe it should be added that when you leave the metro station, you go 600 m (3 blocks) to the RIGHT.

Communication was perfect right from the start: the replies were fast and I received all the information I needed, concerning transport, shops opening hours, etc. She even bought the books I needed for my course, which I wouldn’t have been able to get in time and gave me a lift to City Terminalen on my way back. Fruit and nuts were awaiting me in the room, a very appreciated welcome!

The location is perfect: the studio faces a small park, great for taking a stroll or sitting and reading. An open-air swimming pool is also to be found in the park, just a few hundred meters from the apartment (for those summer days, yes it can get hot in Stockholm!). Walking on you’ll reach Haga Parken, a huge and wonderful park, fantastic for walking, jogging, cycling, taking a plunge in the “lake” or simply relaxing. Sport fans will also find many a gym very close to the apartment (Word Class, SATS, Friskis & Svettis, Pilates Studio, Crossfit). Folkuniversitet is a few blocks away, Techniska Högskola and Stockholm University within easy reach. The city center is 2-3 metro stops away or 20-30 minutes walking. Supermarkets and plenty of bars/restaurants are to be found in all the neighbouring streets.

The studio has everything you need and offers complete privacy. Ilona is there if there’s anything you need, though. She has a washing machine in her part of the apartment, not just in the basement, as many other apartment houses in Stockholm do, which gives greater freedom of use (no reservation lists, you just need to ask).

The only downside is a patchy internet. Alright if you just need it to check your email or the occasional social networking, a bit problematic if you rely on it for serious work or studying. The bed is a bit on the soft side.

All in all this is definitely an apartment I would recommend!"

It is perfectly located between the city centre in the south and the university in the north so I could do everything walking. No need for public transport. Also the connection from the airport via the Alranda Flygbus is good. The internet was indeed a bit weak, but Ilona said she had already ordered a new access point, so I am sure this will be sorted out in due course. Overall I had an excellent experience and would definitely stay again with Ilona!"

She connected with us prior to our flight to enquire about how we were getting to her from the airport & then gave good directions to our studio.  She was welcoming when we arrived & helped us with questions. The Studio was well stocked & Ilona further welcomed us with a bottle of wine & a handmade leaving gift."

Then she provided excellent practical information, very easy to find the appartment and she was there to welcome me. Ilona is very nice and  helpful and makes you feel at home. 

I had a perfect stay, the description fits the reality, clear & clean appartment. The view on the parc just across the street is nice and you can enjoy a drink on the terasse after a long day of walking through Stockholm !

The situation is great, I went to the center walking, which takes between 20 and 30 minutes through animated streets (shops...).

I highly recommend staying there !

The place is really clean and cozy, and in a great neighborhood within walking distance of anything you need. If I ever go back to Stockholm, I'd definitely try to stay here again. No complaints at all. Thanks, Ilona!"

Really a lovely place, one of the nicest Airbnb's I've stayed in, and great for long stays as you have a little kitchen to cook in, if you're so inclined. Otherwise, it's easy to walk just about anywhere, and the neighborhood is very safe, with lots of restaurants and cafes just a block or two away. Would happily come back any time."

The studio apartment was convenient; The kitchen was big enough for making a small en easy breakfast to the two of us, but it wasn't well enough equipped so I would consider it more as a «tea-kitchen» - but no problem for us as we went out for dinner every day. The bathroom was reasonable sized and more important; very clean. The living room / sleeping area had a lot of space and it was very nice to be able to open the balcony door during the night, if it got very hot. Even though the studio is very centrally located, it's placed in a street next to one of the main streets (Sveavägen) and therefore very silent by night.

The bedroom was in Illonas own apartment, but that wasn't any problem. We were glad to have separate sleeping areas, and the bedroom was big and comfortable."

The apartment is as pictured in the photos online; it is cozy and comfortable, and it is very quiet at night.

The neighborhood was quiet and we felt absolutely safe. It was very convenient to be able to walk from the Metro when we arrived as well as grocery stores, food hall (wonderful selection of seafoods that we prepared in the apartment), harbor, restaurants, museums and various other attractions.  Finding the apartment was easy and the key was available when we arrived.  There was plenty of space and the outside balcony was an excellent bonus."

It's in a posh area, there are plenty of fancy restaurants and designer shops to check out. Highly recommended for people who want to experience the Stockholm local life."

The flat was very clean and comfortable. I arrived late in the night but the landlord has been quite flexible and he found a way to get me the keys.

Amazing apartment, clean, comfortable and great sound system.
No wifi unless using a computer but was no issue for us as everything easy to find anyways.

"682",723539,50370892,2015-10-11,44108074,"Vanessa","I stayed at Mathias' with two close friends. As this was the first time using AirBnB I was pretty nervous but it turned out great. Definitely priceworthy. 

The apartment is cozier and more personalized than I feel the pictures and description convey. The cleaning rules might seem rigid, but read once more they are really common sense. I guess Mathias, despite this, has had some negative experienced regarding checking out, hence the rules. 

If you are more than two people you must be okay with sharing beds as there are only one bed and one couch (that you can fold out into a bed). The kitchen is small but felt well planned and well equipped. We never cooked food but found everything we needed for making breakfast and snacks. It might be good to know that you are allowed to use essentials such as tea, coffee, butter, beans etc. If you are unsure just ask Mathias. 

He was reachable by phone and mail the whole stay. Unfortunately we never got the chance to meet but both check in and check out ran smoothly. The day of our arrival he called which was a much appreciated gesture. 

For us the location was perfect: central and quiet with beautiful buildings surrounding us. As an apartment at Östermalm is ridiculously expensive we felt lucky to get to live there, if only for a few days, and felt immediately at home. 

To sum it up: we were all three very happy with our stay and would love staying there again at future visits to Stockholm."

Everything was as expected, the practical details where sorted without hassle. The apartment is a little cold and there is some minor tumbling noise from the roof, but other than that it was perfect for my needs."
"684",723539,56613318,2015-12-15,29549693,"Carl","Exceptional stay and everything as advertised by Mathias in his detailed description and instructions. Apartment was immaculate and well-provisioned. Bathtubs are unusual in Swedish apartments. We needed this to care for a baby during our stay (one of the reasons we chose this specific apartment) and this was a life-saver. Washer and \"drying room\" in the basement also easy and convenient to use once we understood the reservation system. Mostly unused, easy to sign-up. A thoughtful neighbor even came to warn us when he was going to over-run his reserved time! Apartment location was exceptional, we could never afford to live full-time in such a hip, convenient, quiet, mixed resi-shopping-restaurants neighborhood, certainly not in a prosperous city such as Stockholm! Close to subway, bus and ferries. Great supermarkets and a \"Food Hall\" that is a tourist destination in itself. Although we only met Mathias in person once, he had prepared for our stay and the instructions were very thorough. When he needed access to pick-up something, he was very sensitive to our privacy and arranged well in advance. The plants seemed to weather my lack of a green-thumb (our stay was unusually long, about ten days) and provided nice ambiance. The USB Internet worked well once I was able to get a laptop working. I hacked my laptop to make it into a WiFi-repeater to extend The USB Internet so I could use with Smart Phones to avoid the expensive cell company data roaming charges, left Mathias with ideas if he wants to make a more permanent solution for those without USB ports. The kitchen was small but nicely designed and outfitted. A pressure cooker was a bonus and let us quickly prepare fresh organic vegetables from the market. The vacuum cleaner worked well once I learned how to adjust it for the various surfaces. Check-in/check-out went smoothly although the taxi driver from the airport first took us to the wrong address and so the entry keypad code didn't work...his mistake and corrected when he came back to get us! I hesitate to recommend Mathias' apartment only for selfish reasons...I hope to stay there in the future again and wish it to be open!! Seriously, if staying in Stockholm regardless of the season, you can't find a better place for a couple, even with a baby in tow! Didn't try the couch/guest bed, this might even allow for more people."
"685",723539,56975496,2015-12-20,50582633,"Stein","Had a great stay at Mathias' apartment. Mathias was a really nice host, flexible with checking in and out, explained everything we needed to know. The apartment itself has everything you might need. Good beds, good bathroom and even bettet kitchen. 
The USB for internet works pretty good but wifi would make this airbnb even better. Not really a problem though since there's plenty free wifi almost everywhere in Stockholm. If you're going to use the couch as second bed be wary that you can't really blind the window in the livingroom.
Overall Mathias' place is great for a weekend or a week in Stockholm. Almost everything you might wanna visit is in walking distance. Mathias is a nice and flexible host and his apartment was great.

There was only a problem when we arrived. Because some friends showed me the neighbourhood and walked me to Barb’s house, Barb got disturbed and did not provide the key to the appartement. Wich is a pity because I had to text everytime I was going back to the room ! Too bad that I had to give her all my official documents in order to reassure her that I and my friend are not a risk for her. Anyways, it could have stopped at this, but she told me that she had to call the police, which is not a problem for me because i felt secured.
After this little problem, barb was polite and offered us tea and coffee and she let us use the kitchen."

The neighbourhood is perfect for shopping and exploring Stockholm by foot, like Gamla Stan is in 10 minutes walking distance.

Le quartier de l'appartement est très agréable, il y a des restaurants et le quartier est joli à visiter.

We stayed in Stockholm over the weekend, exploring the beautiful city. We only needed a room to sleep in so Barb's place was very nice for that matter. Very comfy bed, clean sheets, big window and a shower, practically all we needed. The internet unfortunately didn't work for us.

It is in the heart of the old quarter of Stockholm (Gamlastan), in a quiet picturesque street. The apartment has a cosy atmosphere very warm and welcoming. I felt at home right away and the more I stayed the more I loved it. It has been a true unique and great experience for me to live there for a short while. The view from the windows is also really beautiful view on the rooftops of the old city and beyond. The apartment was fully equipped and met all my needs.
I truly recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to experience living in Stockholm's old quarter in an old yet super-convenient and comfortable apartment. It's a true - one of a kind. You couldn't ask for a more authentic Stockholm living experience.
Since it's located in the heart of Stockholm, you have many restaurants, supermarkets, metro station, all in a very short walking distance. Also, the most beautiful attractions of Stockholm are just minutes away.
Majken and her boyfriend were super friendly and welcomed me when I arrived and have been very flexible and helpful throughout my stay.
Thank you so much Majken and I hope to come back again to your apartment when I'm back in town. It has been one of my most successful Airbnb experiences :-)"

Ann-Sofie greeted me at the apartment and was very accommodating when my flight was canceled and arrived two days later than scheduled.  Her apartment is lovely, it looks just like the photos provided, and was very clean.  Ann-Sofie asked what I wanted for breakfast and also left many details you don't always get with airbnb apartments - a robe and slippers, toiletries, washing powder, etc.  In fact when I inquired about the washing machine in the apartment and offered to bring my own washing powder she told me not too and to use what she had provided instead.  The apartment is a very short walk to the Odenplan metro stop and there are plenty of grocery stores and restaurants in the area.  It was a very easy experience and I would recommend this apartment to anyone.  Thanks Ann-Sofie!"

The apartment is every bit as good as the photos would indicate and was spotlessly clean.
 The weather was hot at the time of our visit but the numerous windows and door to the balcony make it feel airy and also very light. (The bedroom’s blackout blinds were ideal for the light nights!)
The location is quiet and very convenient for the Odenplan metro station and therefore easy and quick to get to locations all over Stockholm.
We did not meet Ann-Sofie but her communications and instructions were prompt, helpful and clear; so consequently there was no problem with anything.
We would unreservedly and highly recommend this apartment; why would you consider a hotel when you could stay somewhere as lovely as this?

The location of the apartment is perfect, literally right outside of a subway station and with major bus routes 1 or 2 minutes away. This area of Kungsholmen became my favorite part of Stockholm, in the city but with a more neighborhood feel.

As for the apartment itself...absolutely perfect. It's a studio, so it's small of course, but there was an amazing \"a place for everything and everything in its place\" vibe. I stayed for 4 weeks but never had to contact Pernilla as everything I possibly could have needed was there, and her written instructions for things like laundry and garbage/recycling were spot on. It was a wonderful AirBnB stay, and I definitely would have stayed longer if the place had been available."

-quelles activités je pouvais faire 
-quels lieux à visiter. 
Dès que je posait une question elle s'empressait de se renseigner si le lieu était ouvert, si oui combien était l'entrer etc. etc.

De plus, elle m'a proposer de l'accompagner à plusieurs reprise afin de prendre un \"Fika\" (\"apéro\") avec ces amis. 

L'appartement, en plus d'être très propre et bien équipés (TV, wifi, netflix etc..) il est aussi très bien situé, à une centaine de mètre de la station de métro. Il faut compter environ 15-20 min jusqu'au centre de Stockholm. Chaque matin Isabelle proposait un copieux déjeuner, selon les envies que je pouvais avoir.

Das Zimmer ist schön groß, sauber und grenzt an den Wald, was eine schöne Abwechslung ist zur Stadt tagsüber. Auch war Isabelle sehr interessiert an meinen positiven Erfahrungen und Entdeckungen, um sie an zukünftige Gäste weitergeben zu können.

Electra met me upon my arrival (which was late) and she was extremely nice and accommodating. The apartment is very nice and the pictures are accurate, though she has upgraded the bed to a sleeper/sofa that is very comfortable and converts to a chaise lounge when not a bed. As Electra mentions, it's extremely quiet for it being so centrally located as it's on a smaller side street.

Sofo area is amazing.. just a couple blocks from a bunch of cool hipster shops and restaurants.. and a block away from the Metro. Again perfect location!  

Oh and at night time.. when sitting at the kitchen table.. I just loved the views of all the surrounding flats with the candles flickering on the window stands... I would just stare and watch the lovely Swedish architecture with a happy smile.

Henrik was such a cool host, he welcomed me at the flat when I arrived.. showed me around made me feel very comfortable...and even keep in contact with me throughout my stay answering any questions I had, checking in on me, asking if I needed any help etc( via (Hidden by Airbnb) ). I even asked him a bunch of questions and he responded quickly and gave great suggestions!

The location was superb, so close to transport links, and walkable distance to most of the places of interest in the city. The kitchen and bathroom were as one would expect, an the shower was lively, hot and powerful. The apartment was very clean and tidy, with all the things we could possibly need for our stay (other than a kettle). Henrik himself was a lovely host. He welcomed us from the station and showed us to the flat. He seems a reliable and easy going guy, willing to help make the most of the stay in Stockholm. He was flexible with check in and out times also, which was great a we had a late flight back. Thanks Henrik!"

We were given towels and coffee and tee, which was a nice gesture. Viveka is the perfect hostess! She met us at the train station and gave us the key, and let us keep our luggage in the apartment until we left for the airport Sunday evening. She also checked in on us by sms during our stay to see if we needed something.
The apartment is a 5 minutes walk from the subway station, and it takes about 8 minutes to Södermalm and 13 minutes to Gamla Stan. So it's not super central, but not far away either. I would have like to stay a little closer to the city center, but we had a great stay, and would absolutely recommend Viveka's apartment."

The area is kind of semi urban. Not very happening but you'll find a few bars, stores and so on. Quite calm. The very nearby subway station and bus stop makes travel and commute a breeze, it only takes a few minutes by subway to get to livelier areas, the central station and so on."

The apartment was better than imagined, more than was advertised. Cozy furniture, all the appliances necessary for basic cuisining, fast WiFi, a coffeeshop next door, spare towels and sheets; honestly all of our needs were anticipated and met.

Speaking of which, Menaf was an indescribably warm and thoughtful host. Fresh fruit in the fridge for us, very clear instructions of how to get to and in the apartment, checkins to make sure everything was going smoothly. If I ever become an AirBnB host, Menaf will be my role model!"

Near the apartment is a nice area to take a walk along the river.  The public transport (metro) is just 5-10 min away and takes ca 10-15 min to Gamla Stan (old city).

Cons- a good 30 minutes by walk+ train to the city, if you miss the last bus during the evening you would have to walk back and it could be hard with some steep climbs and cold weather. 

Overall, would return and recommend to others :)"

There are not many cooking utensils available (one pot, one pan) and the oven is really more of a microwave.
The bed and sofa-bed were very comfortable.
The neighbors are a bit noisy during the early evening, but the neighborhood gets very quiet in the later hours.
The distance to the grocery store and metro is short and easy to get to.  The ride on the metro to City Center takes a little bit of time."

The studio apartment was just the right size for the two of us. It was clean and tidy and had everyone we need.

The location was beautiful, far enough out of town that it wasn't crowded and a lot of traffic but close enough we could drive anywhere we wanted within about 10 minutes. The apartment itself is beautiful. It was extremely clean and well maintained. We stayed during the time of the midnight sun and the blinds kept it nice and dark for us at night. It was furnished with everything we could have needed. The one and only downside was you had to walk up hill to get there from the parking lot, and it's not even a big hill, we were just tired a lot from jet lag. That is the only negative I could ever say about this place. If we ever come back we will definitely stay here again and I will recommend this place to anyone."

Der Kontakt war im Vorfeld aber sehr gut und auch während unseres Aufenthalts haben wir bei Nachfragen schnelle eine Antwort bekommen. In der Wohnung sind alle notwendigen Informationen hinterlassen.
Die Wohnung selbst ist sauber und für einen Kurzaufenthalt gut ausgestattet. Zu Bus- und U-Bahn-Haltestellen ist es nicht weit. Große Shopping-Malls erreicht man mit dem Auto innerhalb von 10 Minuten.
Kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Jalousien reichen nicht aus, um die Wohnung nachts komplett abzudunkeln. 
Die Pumpe ist sehr laut. Man hört sie immer wenn Wasser abgelassen wird, auch wenn die Nachbarn in der oberen Etage Waser laufen lassen. Nachts ist es besonders nervig.
Die Bewohner in der Wohnung drüber waren ab dem frühen Abend sehr laut (Trampeln, Musik). Dies war fast täglich bis ca. 23 Uhr Standard. 
Ansonsten ist die Wohnung weiterzuempfehlen und für 2-5 Tage würden wir sie wieder buchen.

Die Wohnung war schön und sehr sauber; auch die Ausstattung war super (Kaffeemaschine, Föhn, Pürierstab, Regenschirme, Bügeleisen, Mikrowelle…). Das Bad war ziemlich neu und schick (Fußbodenheizung!). Die Lage der Wohnung ist auch gut; in einer halben Stunde erreicht man zu Fuß Stockholms Altstadt; Supermarkt, Bahn, Einkaufszentrum waren im 3min-Radius. Relativ leise und wirklich warm war die Wohnung auch. Die Sauna im Keller war groß und stand nach vorheriger Anmeldung uns allein zur Verfügung. 
Mikael ist ein absoluter Engel! Wir konnten ihn alles fragen und er hat uns immer geholfen. Er hat uns viele Broschüren über Stockholms Attraktionen zur Verfügung gestellt, im Voraus für uns einen Tisch im Restaurant reserviert und uns 8 Seiten Infos (Anfahrt zur Wohnung vom Flughafen, nähere Umgebung der Wohnung usw.) über Stockholm und die Wohnung per Mail geschickt - und das noch vor der Reise. Während unseres Aufenthaltes durften wir ihm immer eine kurze SMS schreiben, wenn wir Fragen hatten und er hat immer innerhalb von ein paar Minuten geantwortet. Mikael wohnt direkt nebenan und war so immer schnell zur Stelle. 
Es gab wirklich absolut nichts Negatives. Wir haben uns wirklich sehr wohl gefühlt - wie zuhause! Bei Reisen nach Stockholm wird es zukünftig immer in diese Wohnung gehen :)

We were in Stockholm for 8 days with our little baby (7 month old) and the apartment was perfect for our needs. There was a little bed for our boy to sleep in, which worked well.

The apartment is very nice, clean and very warm!  I was worried about this beforehand as it was winter, snowing and about -4 degrees outside.  It is also very quiet and I felt safe walking from there to Stockholm Waterfront conference centre daily at 6.30am.  It is close to shops, transport, the coach stop to the airport and a supermarket.  A very nice place  to stay and it's a shame I couldn't stay for longer.  The centre of Stockholm is quite small, so is easy to walk round and I managed to fit in a visit to Gamla Stan and the fabulous Abba museum too as well as 3 days work.  Thank you to my hosts."

It was nice to feel as if I actually lived in Stockholm but know I could get to the center easily. 

The apartment was very easy to get to from the airport and had many transportation options nearby, which we didn't need since it was so easy to get around by walking, and Mikael showed up some walking routes that were simply gorgeous. The surrounding area had goods places to eat, drink, sip some coffee and a great supermarket.

Mikael himself was a truly amazing host. He made us feel as if we were visiting a friend or relative. He was always available if we needed him and responded to texts/emails quickly.

Die Raumaufteilung hat sich nach dem Einbau einer neuen offenen Küche etwas geändert, was uns noch besser gefällt. Überhaupt ist alles in Wirklichkeit (noch) schöner als abgebildet.
Die Lage in Vasastan ist fantastisch - als Ausgangspunkt für Besichtigungen und Shoppingtouren in der Innenstadt, in der Nachbarschaft findet man zahlreiche nette Cafes und Bars und gute Restaurants, und es ist dennoch sehr ruhig.

Sofie & Jesper ont été très chaleureux et accueillants avec nous. Leur appartement est plutôt spacieux (nous étions 5), moderne et joliment décoré. La cuisine est très moderne et bien équipée.
L'appartement est situé dans un quartier résidentiel plutôt calme, mais à une distance raisonnable à pied du centre-ville. Il y a une station de métro très proche, divers arrêts de bus, des commerces et des restaurants.

La zona e' molto bella e tranquilla a pochi passi c'e' la stazione della metro e una fermata con due linee di bus. Raggiungere il centro storico di Stoccolma risulta molto facile e rapido. L'appartamento e' molto accogliente e pulito con un bel terrazzino. In cucina c'e' tutto il necessario per prepararsi da mangiare.

She showed trust and left us with space for us to feel at ease. She was kind enough to leave valuable information about the neighbourhood on the kitchen table and even had food for our first breakfasts. We enjoyed the quiet neighbourhood with public transports (bus and t-banna) very close by. The t-banna line is the red one which takes you right to Hornstull. Mariatorget, Slussen, Gamla Stan, etc. Also very near to at least one small playground (walking distance). The apartment was great for the two people and a toddler and as a lot of light.

He showed us everything and really is a friendly yet helpful person. The apartment is wonderful. It's spacey, super clean and comfortable. It's conveniently at the ground floor and has a nice patio facing the apartment's courtyard. The location is awesome too, it's at the trendy Östermalm area. The posh Sturegallerian is just steps away, and also the T-bana station, bus, and other public transportations, making it easy to go around the beautiful city. Certainly recommend this place!"

The apartment itself was nice. I stayed in the winter, but I can imagine it's even better in the summer with the patio and the large windows letting in the light.

Location-wise, it's right near everything in the center of Stockholm but still on a quiet street so you don't have to worry about noise.

Highly-recommended!

Right in downtown, the location could not be better. Viktor was so relaxed and very welcoming. It was a great experience - it's his home, so it feels personal and not like a hotel, but it is also kept in such a way that you feel like a welcome friend staying there (not a forced visitor). Would stay here again for sure! Thanks so much, Viktor."

"935",1060165,28703782,2015-03-29,3486354,"Eric","My partner and I stayed for 4 excellent days at Victor's great apartment in Stockholm.  We're from the West Coast of the USA and were traveling in Scandanavia for a couple weeks.  Victor was really kind, super responsible and efficient.  He always responded right away and effectively to any questions we had.  He was also super flexible and relaxed!  We had arrived in the morning, and he made it easy to come right over to meet him so that we didn't have to store our luggage at the station.  We arrived to find he had bought groceries for us so that we would have some food and staples, which greatly eased our transition.   

The apartment is exactly as described only nicer.  The whole place is simply but elegantly designed with wood floors (black slate in the kitchen and bathrooms), white walls, good lighting and a view of a courtyard garden. The bed and sofa are super comfortable.  We slept really well.  Victor left us lots of space for hanging and storing clothes in the closet and he left everything EXTREMELY clean (much appreciated).  The apartment is in a very quiet, well-heated building that looks like it's from the 1940's, full of green granite and all very solid, but clearly refurbished very recently.   There was no noise to speak of.   

The neighborhood of Østermâlm is upscale, full of small shops, boutiques, and interesting restaurants, some of which have glass enclosed gardens so one gets the indoor/outdoor feeling in mid-winter.  There are at least two big supermarkets within a block and a half and a 7-11 just down the block.  The metro (T-bana) is a block away, but one can walk to just about everywhere in Central Stockholm.  Wonderful to be near everything and to explore.  

If you're into exercise while you're traveling, there was a nice gym where one could get a day pass about five minutes walk away, a pool on a health science campus about 15 minutes walk, as well as the huge Olympic size pool near Skanskul  (15 minutes by metro). 
 
Overall, a great place. We were so happy we wished we could stay longer there and certainly would hope to visit again."

The location of Viktor’s apartment is unbeatable: right in the city center close to Stureplan, yet very peaceful and quiet thanks to facing the inner courtyard instead of the street. The apartment itself is very fresh and modern (newly renovated), and even has an outdoor terrace where you can enjoy BBQ (a rarity for such a central apartment!). Viktor was very accomodating, allowing us to check-in and check-out according to our convenience and was very responsive to email and SMS.

We got everything sorted out and had a good stay after that.

Our family of 4 (2 adults & 2 children) stayed at Viktor's apartment.  We used his aero bed and the sofa for the children to sleep.  The apartment is cozy and clean.  The location was fantastic- few blocks from the subway, lots of restaurants, cafes, markets nearby.  It is a very central location.  We had a car and parked on the street.

Although we didn't get to meet Viktor (we were out most of the time and he was swamped with work), he always responded very quickly to my messages.

"951",1060165,42127238,2015-08-11,7111314,"Julie","Viktor was very responsive to my emails and texts. He responded right away to my booking request. He kept good communication with me throughout the process and during my stay. 

The apartment was as advertised, but we didn't realize the washer and dryer were not in the unit. They are in a little room in the basement with a clipboard next to it. The washer and dryer worked great and it was easy to book a time slot. The numbers for the apartments are located on the top doorframe (it took me a while to figure this out). The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. I liked the rain shower head. Also, the brand new IKEA plates were pretty much amazing (Viktor made a special plate delivery during our stay). 

Location of the apartment is perfect. Several great restaurants, a couple grocerily stores etc, are all located within walking distance.

Thanks for allowing us to stay at your apartment Viktor!

It is perfect situated in Östermalm, 2 minutes from T-Bana, a lot of Restaurants and Shops are around this area.
Victor was a very pleasant host; can warmly recommend !
Thank you Victor, we've had a great time!

Viktor is also a very responsive host who will keep you updated and promptly reply to all enquiries."
"954",1060165,44296827,2015-08-25,34996133,"Chris","Viktor was very welcoming in his e-mails to us and made a point of coming by as soon as possible when we got to Stockholm. His apartment is just like the photos and very well-located to a grocery store, liquor store, multiple restaurants, public transportation, and farmer's market.  Be aware that the washer/dryer is not in the apartment (in the basement but easy access & easy to use) and there are no coffee cups or toaster! He also gives you lots of space for your stuff. We had a WONDERFUL time, though, and would definitely stay at Viktor's again!!"

We enjoyed to have dinner on the patio , and you can find 2 supermarkets and a market with take away food just round the corner.
You have the oportunity to store  luggage if you have a  late flight departure. Thanks VIktor for everything"
"957",1060165,45373267,2015-09-02,18488513,"Julie","Viktor was fast to respond to any inquiries prior to the trip. I didn't get to meet him in person, but were given clear instructions to the apartment. His place was exactly as pictured, very clean and well situated within the city. We were able to walk everywhere and access the subway station nearby to get to the airport."
"958",1060165,45575629,2015-09-04,37496028,"Tsahia","We didn't meet Viktor during our short stay in Stockholm so we didn't feel \"hosted\" in Stockholm. The apartment was very comfortable, clean and as described. We were a group of three and would stay there again.  The location was perfect, central to some of the best cafes and a strip of night life. My friends and I had a great time."
"959",1060165,46262225,2015-09-09,2784692,"Kenneth","The apartment is quite pleasant, and was professionally cleaned for our stay, BUT -

We had an agreement that when we arrived in Stockholm we could leave out suitcases, with a promise that Viktor or his cleaner would be there. 

When we arrived at the planned time (in heavy rain) neither was there.

We attempted to contact Viktor but could not on either of the two numbers provided; after some time one call was answered by Viktor's mother who attempted to help but had very limited English (before booking we were assured that communication would be in English).

By pure luck, we met the outgoing guests, who gave us the keys and enabled us to leave our cases.

During this first day we received a text saying that a hairdryer would be delivered that night at 8pm. It did not arrive then, or later. 

Despite these failures we received no apology and indeed no contact from Viktor in person or by phone.

The property was generally as described except that there was no washer or dryer, although both were advertised. This had been an important consideration for us in selecting a property due to the nature of our trip. Also the oven did not work.

The wardrobe was filled with stuff leaving no space for guests to hang their clothes.

The kitchen was basically equiped, but oddly had no cups or mugs for coffee.

No information provided on Stockholm.

No information on the local area (restaurants, shops etc.)

We have now stayed in 15 properties through airbnb, in 6 countries, so we have an understanding of reasonable expectations. In our view this did not meet reasonable expectations and we cannot recommend it.

Viktor was very responsive, and in all ways a perfect host.  I wouldn't ask him to change a thing. I would stay again without reservation, but with reservations."

We walked all over Stockholm from his apartment. The apartment looks just as it is in the listing - perfect for 2 people for a few days. The kitchen and bathroom are on the small side but that didn't matter to us as we were out of the apartment most of the time. I absolutely recommend this apartment for others visiting Stockholm."

A la moindre écoute de nos envies, il a été disponible et très arrangeant quant à notre demande pour un départ tardif !
encore un grand merci pour cela Viktor."

Viktor was easy to reach and responsive both before and during our trip. We had a slight issue unlocking the apartment, but we were able to text Viktor and he fixed the problem within minutes. 

Thanks for a great stay!"

Its a great location and easy to either walk or use public transport to get all over the city. The apartment was very clean and tidy - looking pretty much as in the pictures and Viktor was very helpful answering any queries that we had - both before and during the trip. The newly installed digital lock meant that there was no need for physical checking in or out to collect or hand over keys - and everything worked exactly as Viktor had explained. We'd certainly use this apartment again."

The apartment was quiet and in a really nice part of town, with access to all of Stockholm's attractions only a few mins walk in any direction.

Carl's apartement is small, but very comfortable and you have there everything you need starting from cooking equipment and finishing with internet. Plus one can spend endless time just admiring his amazing book collection. Place is also very well located for exploring Stockholm. There is frequent public transport connection and in case of nice weather you can actually even walk to the center when you feel a bit more sporty.

Foi muito simpático ao deixar um ovo de Páscoa no apartamento no dia em que chegamos.
Neste dia, à noite, nos fez uma visita e deu algumas dicas sobre pontos turísticos em Estocolmo.
Apesar do apartamento estar um pouco afastado dos pontos turísticos, o transporte ônibus + metro funciona muito bem.
Não achamos que seja vantajoso pagar mais caro para ficar mais próximo desses locais.
Recomendamos a estadia no apartamento do Carl.

Although we were three people staying at the slightly smaller apartment, all our needs were met. Carl is a great host, he welcomed us at the apartment had a drink with us and gave a lot of tips with places we might consider visiting both during day and night. Hygiene and cleanness was on a high level. When it comes to its location, the apartment is slightly off the main party/busy area of Stockholm but there is always good public transport connections.

Unsere Reise war recht spontan, Anette hat aber immer ganz schnell reagiert und so hatten wir in kürzester Zeit eine tolle Unterkunft. Die Wohnung ist wirklich schön und man fühlt sich sofort wie bei einer Freundin zu Hause. Die Umgebung ist sehr schön (viele Cafes, entspannte Leute etc.) und genau der richtig Startpunkt für eine Stockholm-Erkundung. 
Alles in allem: perfekt! Ich würde jederzeit gerne wieder bei Anette ein Wochenende in Stockholm verbringen!"

There is everything in the kitchen you need. So I can definitely recommend her place!!!"

I was on a writing deadline and his space provided both inspiration and a quiet, calm atmosphere. Everything was in perfect order, the apartment is in the epicenter of a trendy Stockholm neighborhood, and the bed was divine! Gabriel was also kind enough to let us stay an extra day."

He was gracious enough to accommodate my last-minute request and he was very prompt with his replies. We had a nice but brief chat when I arrived at his place and he checked up on me after the first night to make sure everything was going well.
I definitely got the sense that he loves the area he lives in and gave me some great ideas about where to eat and what to see. He's extremely knowledgable about Stockholm and a very interesting, well-traveled person. The flat is decorated in a very unique and cool way. The curios cabinet in the bedroom was a bit strange to get used to at first, but the lovely bedroom balcony made up for it. 
I didn't spend much time in the flat, as I was out exploring Stockholm or hanging out in Sodermalm bars.
I enjoyed my stay at Gabriel's flat and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a hip area, not far from historical Gamla Stan.

The place itself is very cool, decorated with an artist's eye, lots of light, and very comfortable.  Gabriel was very helpful as well, made sure we knew our way around and was very available for questions.  I would definitely recommend his place to anyone."

Gabriel is very friendly - he met us at the door when we arrived and helped us get settled. His apartment is gorgeous - beautiful old wood floors, antiques, lots of books, a real artist's oasis. It worked perfectly for us. The neighborhood is swimming with restaurants, cafes, and bars from yummy and affordable to high end and fancy and  and shops from vintage funky to high-end designer. There are parks and open spaces everywhere. Söder is my favorite island of Stockholm - very old with beautiful 18th century houses and cobblestone streets, and it was great to get to know this part of it. Very hipster, if that is your thing. I'll definitely be back!"

Appartment was clean and quiet, towels and sheets were included and little breakfest in fridge was also a nice bonus. Jon had acknowledged our 1,5 year old daughter by leaving baby towel and blanket, high chair and some toys for her to play with. Flat was well located close to metro station, restaurants and grocery shops. Jon was not home when we arrived but his mum was friendly to admit us to the flat. We appreciated Jon's restaurant hints! Jon's flat met our expectations and I can warmly recommend his place for anyone who visits Stockholm."

This apt is definitely lived in, and that seems to be what many renters are looking for.  This isn't just a property up for airbnb all year long.

It's only a couple blocks to the subway.  Very nice.  Also, not far from Mariongorget.  It
S one subway stop, and there are cute coffee places and more along the pretty grassy square.  Easily walkable from the apt.

It's in a perfect location with a short walk into Hornstull (and the tube station) as well as being, literally, across the road from the amazing island of Langholmen, which is perfect for a morning stroll.
Klara sent us really useful information about accessing the building and the amenities of the area before hand, which was extremely helpful as it was our first time in Stockholm.
Unfortunately we weren't able to meet Klara on our visit but she arranged to have her friend meet us when we arrived to drop off the keys. Very impressed overall!"

We often had coffee at the Rio Pio theater, and enjoyed the market by the water on Sunday morning. We walked home every day from other parts of the city along the top of Sodermalm, watching the sun get closer to the horizon along montelius vagnus, then making our way to a view point with bald boulders, just over an old factory tower. One other bit of advice: if you see large groups drinking by the water, you should join them! Our favorite days ended at bars and beer gardens along the canal."

The studio is exactly as seen in the pictures. The flat is beautifully decorated and a shining example of how to decorate a studio apartment where space is limited. 
The flat is located a nice 4 minute walk from Hornstull metro, in a quiet spot right next to a couple of parks. 
Klara was very nice and easy to communicate with. I would not hesitate one moment to book this listing again. Thank you Klara"

Lots of cafes,restaurants  and bars. A few minutes walk to Hornstull station, where there is a supermarket and other shops,  and from there you can get to pretty much anywhere in a few minutes, we didn't use the t-bana much and instead walked and explored. It's a really gorgeous walk from the apartment to the old town by the river, and after having a few drinks in some great bars in 'SoFo' we would walk back to the apartment from there too.

Klara always responded promptly to any questions we had and we felt really welcome, her tips for the area were great, had cinnamon buns for breakfast every morning I was there! Delicious!

I've only rented condos or homes when I've not stayed in hotels in the past and been expected to launder sheets and towels (or bring my own) and clean the house before leaving. This was a true bed and breakfast and Terry was a true and gracious host. He arranged for a car for us so we had transport to the apartment, then greeted us with an amazing spread of food, including delicious homemade pasta and salad dishes. The kitchen was stocked with all the essentials, as was the bath, should we have needed additional toiletries. He shared all the tips we'd need to get around town, and was responsive when we reached out to him. I would not only stay there again but also stay in other Airbnb properties based on this experience. Terry, you're the best! Thanks again!"

Selvom jeg var så sent på den var Diana sød og imødekommende.
Oveni havde hun købt brød, kaffe, juice mm. så jag havde lidt til om morgenen når jeg vågnede. Lejligheden var ren og lækker, en hyggelig lejlighed, der kunne rumme 3 mennesker uden problemer.

The location of the apartment is in a suburb of Stockholm, quiet, and in a charming park-like setting, with lots of families and children.  Once we figured out the shortcut, it's only a few minutes walk to the metro station.  The metro is on a street filled with shops, including 3 supermarkets, a produce market, a couple of restaurants and cafes.  From there, it's a direct 20-minute metro ride into central Stockholm, so it was very convenient.  However, when we first arrived it was very difficult to find the apartment since the layout of the buildings is quite confusing.
In addition to a comfortable single bed and an equally comfortable sofabed, the apartment is nicely furnished, including the very pleasant balcony overlooking the trees.  The kitchen was extremely well-equipped with everything we needed to make virtually all our meals, and Diana left a great deal of food for us.  The Internet worked perfectly.  There is a washer and dryer available a few buildings away and you can schedule a time slot in advance which was helpful.  Overall, we enjoyed our Stockholm Airbnb experience very much."

The flat was bright with daylight even in the middle of January. Annika's photographs capture the flat very well. My experience was that the flat was spacious, well heated with plenty of hot water too. The decor is calm. The bed very comfortable - though I did manage to bump my head off a low corner over it, despite Annika's warnings.

The streets outside are relatively quiet though you can look down on the distant hustle and bustle. There are lots of restaurants, cafes, shops and bars nearby. So it's very well placed for exploring Sodermalm.

We certainly enjoyed the balcony (breakfast under sunshine is always a delight) and the neighborhood. Lots of coffees, restaurants and shopping places. You can walk easily to the old city by the Monteliusvagen walk (a really peacefull walk and the best view upon the City). Even though the appartement is located in the city, the place is really calm. You can hear the seagulls sing every morning. Directly outside of the appartement you have supermarkets for food shopping and buses, the subway station to reach the center of the city in 10 minutes.

So.. I Would totally recommend this flat, both for the flat itself and for the host, which sometimes in airbnb is even more important.

L'appartamento, molto accogliente,  ha superato le aspettative.Unico incoveniente, per gente un pò avanti negli anni come noi, la mancanza di ascensore. Il quartiere è fornito di negozi e ristoranti e molto comodo per i mezzi di trasporto.
Un'esperienza assolutamente da ripetere anche per il calore della famiglia Gandini!"

Christian met us when we got there, gave us a quick tour, and everything was easy to find and use. The apartment was very comfortable, spacious, bright cozy, and the two floors each have bedrooms and bathrooms, so it was easy to \"spread out\" and have our own space, even while staying in the same apartment. Christian has a very reasonable list of \"house rules\" and that should only demonstrate to you that he cares about you and the apartment more than most. The full kitchen had all the little things you might need, the bathrooms both have showers, there are two balconies, and it feels like a home, not a rental. We had absolutely no complaints. Highly recommended."

He communicated well in advance with all the details about the booking and once our guests had checked in, Christian followed up to make sure that they were comfortable.

The apartment itself is beautiful and we certainly felt a sense of \"place\": it reflects the Swedish sense of style. We had everything we needed and it proved a great jumping off point for our exploration of the city. There is very easy access to the great Stockholm public transportation network, but it is also easy to walk into the city centre. There are plenty of restaurants in the neighbourhood as well. All in all we would heartily recommend this apartment to others."

We felt very much at home in the appartment which is very spacious.  The appartment is in a great location with a train station and local buses just 5 minutes walk from the appartment.  If we were to go back to Stockholm again we would have no hesitation in staying there again."

The apartment was in very clean and tidy shape, and we were very excited to start our European adventure there! The four bedrooms suited the 6 of us very comfortably, especially having two bathrooms and two balconies! He is a really wonderful host who is accommodating, kind, and very willing to help you find what you need (grocery store, bank, shopping, etc.). I would HIGHLY recommend him and this apartment to anyone visiting Stockholm! Thank you, Christian!! :)"

At bo i en lejlighed er perfekt når man rejser med mindre børn, og der var legetøj osv. klar til dem hvilket var et stort hit!Christian var den perfekte vært, trods han har ikke var fysisk tilstede, var han meget opmærksom på vores ankomst og ophold via mail. Og det fungerede upåklageligt at hente og aflevere nøglen i 7eleven!

My wife and I shared a large master bedroom on the first floor where the kitchen and living room are located, while the three boys each had their own bedroom plus recreation area on the second floor.  
The apartment is centrally located close to the St. Eriksplan metro stop and a twenty minute walk from Central train station.  Shopping for food is easy as grocery stores are only a couple of minutes' walk away.  Many good restaurants are located on the same street close by.
We were very pleased with our choice of apartment and would gladly rent it again.  It was an ideal location for us to visit Stockholm, a very beautiful city, particularly in the summer."

Each one had his own real room and real bed, everything is clean, comfortable and warmful (special bonus for some furniture). The appartment is quiet (upon an inner courtyard with no noise, no cars). The balconies are perfect to have breakfeast on a sunny day in the morning. The neighborhoods are desserved by a direct train to central station and subway line, which is very comfortable to move around the city. The street of the building is pleinty of restaurants and alimentary shops and commodities.
I talked to christian by e-mail several months before arriving and he was available by mail for any question during our estancy. Have a nice journey in Stockholm! Tim"

La ubicacion es perfecta, en una zona tranquila pero rodeada de comercios y lugares donde comprar algo de comida y tomar algo, y es ideal para llegar desde Arlanda con autobus. El metro esta muy cerca pero es una buena zona para pasear hasta el Town Hall por el Norr Mälastrand.
Peter es un gran anfitrion, vino a saludarnos y por si necesitabamos alguna cosa. Y habia mapas y guias en la cocina para que el primer dia pudieramos hacernos una idea de la zona y la ciudad.
Realmente una perfecta opcion para alojarse en la ciudad, que por seguro, repetiria en una futura visita."

The patio smelled like smoke the entire time we stayed there. The door was really hard to use (to the point where we weren't sure if we would be able to get in at night) and there weren't special instructions. You were expected to squeegee the floor yourself after you showered. Overall, I wasn't super impressed and could have stayed in a hotel that included breakfast for the price we paid for the room."

Regardless, his place was pretty well kept. There were two other rooms, both occupied by other tourists (all of which were really friendly!)

The neighborhood was perfect and close to the attractions. And the Champion's League final was playing in the bar downstairs and my favorite player scored the decisive goal. So yes, I had an amazing stay. My only regret is that my wife wasn't there to share it with me. Thank you Peter!

The apartment is very big, clean and functional. The shared bathroom is adequate and kitchen has everything you need. The bedroom is very large - with king size bed, couch, wardrobe and dresser. Our favourite part was the balcony - which is a great place to take in the long sunny evenings - Bonus! 

A bit of walk from the city centre - maybe about 25 minutes -  but a very good place to stay Stockholm."

The apartment is fully rented out by airbnb so we shared it with other two groups of people who were travelling as well, making it feel more hostel-like than staying with a host. That was more than okay for us as we knew our way around but maybe that is not the case for everyone. The apartment was nice and clean, with all the amenities we needed.

The location was okay - close to the metro stop so it is easy to get anywhere, it is on a busy street so a lot of places to eat/cafes however it definitely is not my favourite part of Stockholm. 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay, it was hassle-free and nice, exactly what we needed for one night."

After toting  our luggage from central station to the train station near his apartment and down the street a few blocks, it was disappointing that the place was pretty warm with little air flow. The balcony is mostly enclosed by glass so opening the window doesn't get a breeze and there were no fans. Peter was a helpful host though with clear direction on getting in and gave us space once there. One thing we didn't realize was he sometimes has multiple air BB guests at one time."

Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen, 20 Minuten zur Fuß vom Hauptbahnhof oder noch schneller mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen.

Wir hatten eins der Balkon Zimmer; der Balkon ging zum Innenhof raus und es war sehr ruhig Nachts. Unser Zimmer war geht-so sauber, Badezimmer und Küche waren auch geht-so sauber (Hostel-Style). Küche war voll ausgestattet zum Kochen und mit übergebliebenen Essen ehemaliger Bewohner ( sowie Nudeln, Reis, Gewürze...). 

Peter haben wir in den drei Tagen nicht einmal gesehen. Andere Bewohner die wir kennen gelernt haben, haben Peter auch nie gesehen. Offensichtlich vermietet er die drei Zimmer des Apartments alle als airbnb Zimmer.

..that there are others living in the flat, and that the host does not live there himself.

I'm a host myself and try and take good care of my guests, from the moment they book to the moment they leave.  Perhaps the most memorable attribute was the instructions to, upon arrival, only *take one of the keys* taped underneath the carpet in front of the door.

I'm including this here in the interest of future guests feeling more safe in an otherwise shady apartment building."

Toutefois, l'arrivée a été très pratique, nous avons récupéré la clé facilement, et l'appartement est bien situé  (15 minutes à pied de Centralterminalem)."

Seine Wegbeschreibung war sehr exakt und hilfreich. Die Location ist echt zentral, Busse und Metro fast direkt vor der Haustür, und in wenigen Minuten ist man so in der Innenstadt. Was man durch die Airbnb-Anzeige nicht erfährt: Der Vermieter wohnt nicht im Apartment, stattdessen werden alle 3 Zimmer vermietet. Zeitweise waren wir 7 Gäste, die sich ein Bad teilen mussten. Hauptproblem war, dass der ganze Ort (Küche, Zimmer und leider auch das Bad) nicht wirklich sauber waren. Es roch auch etwas merkwürdig. Ich war bei der Buchung froh, noch etwas Zentrales zu finden, das nicht allzu teuer war. Trotzdem würde ich dieses Zimmer nicht wieder buchen."

Peter selbst war sehr freundlich und über die AirBnB Website oder per SMS erreichbar falls Fragen oder Probleme auftauchen sollten, dies war bei unserem Aufenthalt jedoch nicht der Fall.
Was noch anzumerken ist, ist dass Peter selbst nicht in der angebotenen Wohnung wohnt, alle 3 Räume der Wohnung sind an wechselnde Gäste vermietet. Hierdurch haben wir Peter recht selten angetroffen, was an dieser Stelle jedoch völlig neutral erwähnt sein soll. Auf Fragen, die ich im Vorfeld über die AirBnB Website gestellt habe hat er immer sehr schnell und freundlich geantwortet und war allgemein sehr hilfsbereit.
Bad und Küche waren ebenfalls stets sauber und gepflegt.
Der kleine Balkon war sehr schön, gerade wenn morgens die Sonne darauf schien.
Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen, wer gut zu Fuß ist kann sogar in die Innenstadt (Gamla Stan) laufen, dies haben wir an unserem ersten Tag getan, sonst jedoch lieber die 4/5 Haltestellen mit der Metro zurückgelegt, Bus und U-Bahn Haltestellen befinden sich nahe der Wohnung, ein Supermarkt ist ebenfalls nicht weit.

Allgemein war es ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt, ich würde Peter's Wohnung jederzeit weiterempfehlen.

The apartment is located 15 mins from the centre of Stockholm. So location wise it was perfect. The apartment comprised of a kitchen with dining space, three bed rooms and a shared toilet and bathroom. I must highlight over here that if you are bag packing then it is probably an ok place for you. But if you are visiting with family then it is an absolutely \"no no\". First of all the basin was clogging all the time and it was very dirty. The bedroom which my parents were using did not have any room for movement after an extra mattress was added for me. I had initially thought that I would get a separate room with a proper bed. The cupboard was full of dirt and the floor was also not cleaned properly, though we were asked to take off our shoes while entering the house, which we did. All in all, it was not really a pleasant experience for me as well as for my parents."

The apartment itself is a real gem: take a close look to the gorgeous living room: in real, it is even more impressive! No doubt  to have here: Viktor got quite a eye and taste when it's time to create an ambiance and for home decoration. And very important, it was super clean! Don't worry about communication: super fast answer, often within minutes.

And Stockholm: what a city to enjoy and discover. We will certainly come back sooner then later and i'll contact Viktor for his place for sure

Many thanks"

The neighbourhood is also outstanding. Lots of shops and bars and cafes, and it's a world away from the touristy areas of the city.

The site really says it all : it's a very nice place and Maud is a very nice lady !
We had the best of times, we felt really welcome, and felt very much at home from the first minute.
We're cat people, that helps of course, and i must say the cats are two real beauties, very sociable, and wander around freely, but are never a nuisance and are strictly kept out of the bedroom.
Maud is a a great source of information about the city and the 'Swedish way of life', very easygoing, and a lovely lady and i'm sure we'll meet again!
The place is cosy, very clean and well-organised, you can tell Maud is not new at the travellers scene !
I especially want to mention the well-equipped kitchen ( we cooked dinner every night - there's a small 'Coop'- and a big 'Maxi'-supermarket within walking distance ).
The apartment is 7 stops ( 15 min ) from the 'T-Central'-Subway/Train/Bus-stations and a five-minute walk from the Tunnelbana-Metro-Stop. 
The only reason not to book at Mauds would be a cat allergy. Greetings from Bruges Belgium !

We walked home from Gamla Stan once and you have a nice park pretty much the whole way. 
The room is exactly as described, we used kitchen a lot (you get your own place in the fridge and on the shelves and can use pans and such) and there are even teas and cookies left for you, which is always super nice.

Maud was also very organised and the room was clean, tidy and well put together. Her apartment is situated in a nice neighborhood, two minitues walk to the metro station which we used to go around the city. Also a big supermarket (ICA Maxi) is less than three minutes walk from the apartment which i found useful."

The apartment is very clean and cozy and the cats are lovely. The location is excellent: the neighboorhood is great and the metrostation and supermarket are close. 

Furthermore, Maud is a very helping person. She gave us valuable information about the city, for example about using the citybike network, which we really recommend in combination with a SL card. 

We would love to visit Stockholm again some time.. and hope we could then book with Maud again:)!

Thanks a lot Maud!"

Maud is very nice and helpful. The small kitchen is also perfect because I can cook for my self everyday. The metro station and supermarket is just nearby, and the best part of the community is that the waterfront is in 3 mins walking distance. I walk along the waterfront every evening and feel really peace and relaxed. Because of this experience, I am sure I will use airbnb as a first choice for future trips."

Her two cats are really cute and were an added bonus. Even though our stay was for only one night, it was great. Definitely recommend this place. She even printed out our boarding passes for us when we were checking out (which she didn't have to do, but it was really nice of her to help us out). We forgot about the check out time though and stayed a bit later than we should have, but she was very understanding."
"1292",1212891,38092332,2015-07-13,5900896,"Allison","Maud made us feel extremely welcome from the moment she opened the door and gave us the tour. Her home is very close to the metro line and everything is described very well on the listing page. She is truly one of the most welcoming airbnb hosts. I really did feel at home during our 4 night stay, and had full access to her kitchen which I used extensively. The shared spaces are organized perfectly and labeled for guest use (there are 2 guest rooms available). Everything was very clean on arrival and stayed that way throughout our stay despite both of the guest rooms being occupied. Maud does a wonderful job! 

The area/neighborhood is very nice and cozy, and close to the waterfront and walking paths, as well as the huge grocery (and other item) store. We saw bunnies/hares all the time right outside the window, and had fun with Maud's cats as well. I saw very very minimal cat hair in the home (2 long haired cats), and did not have any allergy flare-ups. This is a great place and comfortable homely stay for a very reasonable price in Stockholm."

Maud is very organized at letting you know what is on and off limits, and is very open to kitchen and bathroom use. You'll also get towels. There are 2 cats so keep in mind if you're allergic because even though they don't enter the rooms they are the furry type. Location wise you'll be a 10 min walk to the subway and a 15 min subway to downtow, It's not preciselly in the city center but for us it was great as we prefer somwhere calm."

La cuisine et la salle de bain sont utilisables en toute liberté. Maud est une personne très accueillante et serviable, tout à fait disposée à donner des renseignements sur la vie à Stockholm. 
L'appartement est par ailleurs très bien placé, à cinq minutes à pied du métro et des supermarchés environnants. De plus le quartier est très agréable, avec la proximité de quais donnant sur le lac Mälar.

We felt at home, her cats are lovely too. The room is bright and full of light, the flat clean and the cooking facility so confortable. The underground close to her place and easy to reach. Maud was very kind and did the best for us. We had a good time as she has a great sense of hospitality."

She then started to explain how things are working and showed me my room for the next days, which were very comfortable. I didn't ever sleep so well during a journey as in this quiet little room.  But also her two sweet cats gave me the feeling of being at home. 

To the public transportation system (subway) it's just a few minutes of walk and also two supermarkets are quite close.

You don't even realize how small her apt is because she takes care of every single detail. Our room was spotless and she keeps the entire apartment clean even though she has two (gorgeous) cats and another guest when we were there. She marks down everything clearly in her apt for her guests so that it is clear what is ok for them to use - I really appreciated that. It was very easy to get to the city center, and I would highly recommend Maud's place to anyone as it is excellent value for money. Also her cats are hypo-allergenic so don't worry even if you have cat allergies :)"

The bedroom is a decent size with a comfortable size, the bathroom though small has a wide range of toiletteries for the use of the guests.
  Although another long term guest was using the other bedroom, we were not really inconvenienced.

Maud was really helpful as usual, and even offered to pick up a few items for me when she was on her way to the grocery store. The room is  comfortable and ( just as the smaller one) on the sunny side of the building -- but there's a dark curtain you can roll down if you need to block the early morning sun i the summer."

The house has several \"plusses\" as free shower gel, cofee, tea, herbs to cook... Etc. All the house is well-equipped and very clean.

She had notes everywhere, towels ready to go, water on the bedside table, Stockholm travel book on table, etc. She has a great system for checking in and out where you can come any time using a code. She is very friendly and easy-going and makes you feel very welcomed in her home. 

This was our first visit to Stockholm and Maud's place initially caught our eye because of her relatively very low price to others, even though she's on the outskirts of the city. Because we didn't know the area, we didn't realize that we'd be taking taxis/ubers/the Metro to get back and forth to the City and Gamla Stan so frequently, and that it probably would have been the same if not less expensive to stay in a more central location. It's something to consider and research ahead of time and take into consideration with the price when planning your trip. 

However we have no regrets staying with Maud and really enjoyed meeting her and staying with her in Stockholm! She is by far the most professional and organized host we have stayed with yet using this site."

We truly appreciated her generosity when she prepared a homemade meal for us.  We talked a lot and Maud showed us some personal family photos.  Her cats are sweet and social.  The room itself was very private and homey.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the perfect size for two adults.  The location was far enough away from the city where we were amongst locals and away from a lot of tourist traps.  The metro was close so it was a short ride into the heart of Stockholm.  I would advise purchasing a 72 hour SL access card for the train upon arriving.  Overall, we had a great time with Maud and would stay with her again in a heartbeat."

It is spacious, comfortable, and well equipped, and we enjoyed watching a DVD every night while lying in bed!

Location is great, only a short walk from everything. Even though you can walk pretty much everywhere in Stockholm, if you want to take the metro, the station is only a 3 minute walk away. The area, Kungsholmen, is mostly residential but has lots of restaurants and cafes. The pizza place on the corner is very good, and very reasonably priced. There is a supermarket around the corner as well. We were very happy with the location.

The shower was a little bit annoying as there is nowhere to hang up the nozzle, but it is no problem if you want a bath. Also, the bed is actually two single mattresses side by side, which was a little drawback, but both of these things are pretty minor. All in all we would definitely recommend this place!"

Longer version: Nicely furnished apartment in a nice neighborhood. Loved the way it's decorated, loved the location, great DVD collection. Really has everything you need for a trip to Stockholm. Supermarket, shops, a park and subway-station are within a short walking distance. Nathalie is a super-nice person and great host. Checking in occasionally to see if there's anything you need. Really the only bummer was that we didn't manage to actually meet. 
Would definitely go there again!"

The facilities are good, we loved the trampoline and sauna, the neighborhood is quiet and friendly and the house is close to the tunelbana (underground). The host was friendly, very welcoming and helpful in arranging things for us to make us feel welcome and at home, not only in his house but also in Stockholm. When we had a question he always answered very fast. When he wanted to get something from his house he always asked in advance whether it was ok for him to pass by to get his things.
If we could, we would have stayed much longer :-)

Jacob answered messages very quickly and was available on his phone whenever we needed.  The house was perfect for our 6 people with a great location only a 5 minute walk from subway, sauna for after long days of walking and comfortable for sleeping.  I would highly recommend Jacob and his place for anyone going to Stockholm and would definitely stay here when we return."

The house was clean, warm, comfortable and close to the train so easy to get to downtown. He had breakfast for the first day in the house for us and dropped off umbrellas, coffee and a pastry on the second day.  Totally worth being outside of the Sentrum for the lovely Swedish hospitality!  Highly recommended!"

Jacob fait en sorte que l'on se sente comme chez soi, et donne tous les conseils nécessaires pour passer des vacances parfaites.

There are lots of little touches that make you feel very much at home. The house is really easy to find and is in a very quiet area yet very close to the centre of Stockholm either by public transport or by driving (if you are used to driving in a major city, Stockholm is no problem). When we arrived, there were deer in the garden; yes this really is a green area. 

We love the use of colour in the house. Breakfast in the fridge was a welcome touch."

He was helpful and hospitable in every possible way and did everything to make our stay as enjoyable as possible - including caring for food and drinks as well as giving great suggestions where to spend time and what to do in Stockholm. We felt very welcome and truly had the impression that Jacos is genuinely interested in the people he hosts. Short: Jacob is a host extraordinare ;-)  
The house is very convienently located. Public transportation is a mere 5 minutes walk away, getting to the buzzing areas of Stockholm, such as Södermalm only takes a couple of minutes. Same applies to a large convenience store, bakery, restaurants etc.
Despite the central location, the environment is very quiet, We even had deer in the garden at multiple occasions (much to the enjoyment of our kids).
The house and its equipment is very much as described and shown in the pictures. We had a great, relaxed stay at Jacob's house!"

are allergic to down and duck feathers and I had a problem there.
We were able to do something about it ourselves, however Per
was very kind and would have done something about it had he known.

The city center is easily reached by tram/metro or bus.
The area is quiet and green, there is a garden adjacent to one of the balconies. You can park you car on the street next to the garden, it's free.
(There is a 5 hour period per week on all streets in the neighbourhood in which you are not allowed to park. We didn't see the sign and got a parking ticket.) 
Highly recommended appartement!"

Very tiny bathroom by American standards, but the Stockholm shower actually works really well and is a space-saver. There is a stunning view of Högalids Kyrka and its surrounding park from the ceiling-high windows. A huge Hemköp grocery is just blocks away at the Hornstull \"mall\" with fresh, beautiful food. Lots of great shops (H&M Home!); juice bars, sushi, tapas, pizza and Lebanese restaurants and several great bars for people watching. One of the most beautiful 180° views of Stockholm is available by walking along Söder Mälarstrand, accessible within minutes from the apartment. If you're there in the summer be sure to look for the stretch of canal under and near the nearby bridges that contains dozens of mint-condition, vintage wooden speedboats. We had dinner at a terrific tapas place, Linje Tio at 24 Hornsbruksgatan."

She gives a great orientation with her daughter, and even provided some food, e.g., fruit, chips, candy, cheese.  The apartment is perfect from many (Website hidden by Airbnb) a 4 minute walk to the T-bana and is a 10 minute ride to Gamla Stan and Centralen.  I actually enjoyed take the # 4 bus, which is short walk as well.  The apartment is very comfortable, nice furnishings, dishwasher, good wi-fi, cable tv with many English speaking stations and a washer/dryer in the basement.  The only concern for Americans would be the very small bathroom.  I was fine with it but some of my compatriots are used to big luxurious bathrooms.  If that's you, Sweden isn't the country for you.  I met many locals who told me the small bathroom in the apartment is typical to most Swedish apartments.  Honestly, for a week, it wasn't a problem for me whatsoever.  I highly recommend this apartment.  You will love it and will be made to feel at home by the lovely host.

We had a great experience staying at the flat, the area is very quiet with a few hip cafes, bars and restaurants in close walking distance. The metro line is a short 5 min walk and Marie Louise gave us some great tips on places to eat and see while we were visiting town.  She also left us snacks too.

She provided us with plenty of hints and tips for our stay and had, very generously, left some fruit, crisps and sweets for us to enjoy. Not at all expected, but a lovely surprise. The apartment is in a good location, close to shops, restaurants and the metro.

It is nice feeling of gratitude in that first moment, and a pleasure the rest of the days.

We wanted to stay in Sodermalm, but also be in a quiet part of the neighborhood that was easily accessible to the train station. The apartment itself is exactly as pictured, the bedrooms are comfortable, the kitchen is incredibly spacious, the bathroom is amazing, and the living room is incredibly inviting. Madeleine has amazing taste, and it shows in all the beautiful accents one finds in each room. Madeleine was also very easy to communicate with, and made our stay very welcome. She also did a great job leaving information about the apartment and things to do in Stockholm. Thanks Madeleine!"

Inzio col dire che Peter è stato incredibilmente gentile fornendoci in maniera dettagliata tutte le informazioni per raggiungere la sua casa dall'aeroporto.  Si è inoltre reso disponibile a affittarci la stanza nonostante saremo arrivati di sera molto tardi. La casa è super comoda: in circa 15 minuti si arriva in centro con la metropolitana (la cui fermata è a un minuto dal portone). Nel quartiere, ben frequentato,  si possono trovare negozi di ogni genere,supermercati ecc. La stanza corrisponde perfettamente alla descrizione, molto spaziosa, con asciugacapelli,  asciugamani e lenzuola. La casa ha in tutto tre camere quindi non c'è stato alcun problema per il bagno in comune e la cucina è dotata di ogni cosa!  Un'esperienza assolutamente da consigliare!!"

It's very near central station, a few stops away and nearby is the pick up to the flybus going to the airport.

We never actually met Peter - just other guests, some who were just arriving and some who were just leaving. I think Peter's place is fine for a quick night on a budget but if I went back for an extended period of time I may find a different place that had thicker walls and less other travelers sharing the space.

Additionally the room we rented was to have a balcony but there was no door acces to the balcony other than the window which was a bit ironic.
We didnt get chance to meet tha landlord .
to conclude with we were told that we had to take our shoes off upon entering the house.We did but house itself wasnt clean enough to walked barefoot .
despite everything it had better conditions than a regular hostel which is widely chosen by the younger population."

It's located about a 15 transit ride outside of the the downtown area with lots of shops and groceries stores in very close proximity.  Peter was communicative the entire time and I felt good knowing when I texted him he would respond promptly.  I would say that the room provides value rather than luxury.  After Peter texted me the location of the sheets I was able to make the bed, I slept well in the quiet neighborhood."

The biggest problem we had is that there wasn't any shower, it was just floor something that is not shown at the photos. Furthermore even though probably it was our fault, but my friends and I were prepared for a private apartment and not for just a private room, the other guests were very quiet and good so there wasn't any problem. Kitchen has some food as pasta which helped us much to avoid going to the supermarket very often, but there were many packages that had been expired. Finally as I travelled at that period with my friends in other two countries, I wouldn't say it was the cleanest apartment we had. Finally Peter was great and helped us with any problem and question we had."

"1552",1326959,38891555,2015-07-19,1139266,"Linda","Kajje was a great host. She gave very clear directions and met with me when I arrived in Stockholm after a 12-hour flight. Was super nice, relatable, and gave me helpful recommendations for things to do around the city.

The pictures of the flat are completely accurate to the experience: very Scandinavian, particularly Swedish, and EXTREMELY CLEAN. Her towels were some of the best-smelling ones I've encountered at an Airbnb. The bed was cozy and comfortable, and the living-room area was so generous. The bathroom was spotless, and she even had shampoo to use.

I loved the neighborhood. A few other reviewers were complaining about it being far from Gamla Stan, the old neighborhood, but I actually liked that it was so. When you a little bit further (but not inconveniently) from the super touristy areas, you get to experience life in the city you're visiting as though you were a local. That's tremendously important to me, and the area of Södermalm was perfect for such an experience. Walk up the street for 10 or 15 minutes or so, and there are great cafes and some of the best views in all of Stockholm. Kajje's apartment, I would argue, is desirably located, more so than even the areas where there are the super established, fancy hotels.

Thanks to Kajje for hosting me for five nights. It made Stockholm feel like home!"

Kajje war sehr höflich und freundlich; während meiner Anwesenheit hat sie nicht in der Wohnung übernachtet und war nur ab und zu da, um etwas aus der Wohnung zu holen. Schade fand ich, erst bei meiner Ankunft zu erfahren, dass das gesamte Haus aufgrund von Fassadenarbeiten eine Baustelle ist; gehört hat man davon überhaupt nichts, aber alle Scheiben waren deswegen verklebt, weshalb wenig Licht in die Wohnung kam und man die Fenster nicht öffnen konnte, um Luft herein zu lassen. Da ist aber zum Glück ja nur temporär, und vor der Buchung kenn man sich ja bei Kajje erkundigen, wie der aktuelle Stand ist, deshalb: DIe Unterkunft ist toll und absolut zu empfehlen!"

Nous avons tout particulièrement aimé le quartier (Södermalm) : vivant, agréable. On se sent immédiatement à l’aise. Des cafés, des restaurants, des boutiques de toutes sortes, un centre culturel avec une bibliothèque, des habitants sympas. 
Côté approvisionnement… il y a de quoi faire. Des petits supermarchés ouverts tard et 7j/7 sont tout proches.
Et, si comme nous, vous venez avec un enfant, il y a aussi un espace de jeux avec un petit terrain de foot juste en bas de l’immeuble.

We arrived past midnight and she was waiting for us on the steps beside the building door. (sorry i was in such a rush to get to your place once we landed that i forgot to switch on my phone...)

We stayed at her place while the neighbours upstairs were renovating their bathroom. Upon receiving news of the renovation, Marianne contacted me and was very patient in explaining the situation. She even offered to refund us the money and have us find another apartment to stay. However, that was already close to the trip and we could not find another place at such short notice. We somehow managed to work around the problem (Marianne got the workers to start work a bit later to accommodate us, while we had to wake up early the first morning to be ready before the water got cut off, leaving home early subsequent days to avoid the drilling noises, etc.).

The appartment is very cosy and well-equiped. My 2 grandchildren enjoied the playgrounds in the area. We also enjoied the park, Tantorlunden, nearby. And the yuongsters went swimming. Close to train, busses and so on."
"1588",1337420,38096239,2015-07-13,27775426,"Dorothy","We loved staying at this apartment.  Our host met us at the local train exit and walked with us to the apartment via a shortcut by a local grocery store.  She showed us the apartment, explained how the dishwasher and washing machine worked, and showed us where the coffee press was (most important of all!).  The apartment was very conveniently located, and it was easy to get to other sections of Stockholm.  We also found it to be in walking distance of my great-grandmother's home from a hundred years before!  After full days of sightseeing, it was comfortable and pleasant to return to the apartment.
The host was most pleasant and easy to work with.  The apartment was clean and well organized, and there were few outside noises.  The apartment complex has flowers, trees, and small parks.  If we are able to return to Stockholm, we would love to stay there again."

La zona nos gustó mucho, a solo tres paradas de metro de T-Centralen , y una parada en tren (cercanías), y en un barrio con un ambiente muy agradable, cerca de un parque enorme que también tenía una pequeña playa, zona de minigolf para jugar... la experiencia ha sido muy buena y yo recomendaría la casa sin dudarlo. Eva nos recibió y nos explicó lo más importante de la casa y además nos dejó mapas y lugares recomendados por ella para visitar en Estocolmo."

Die Wohnung ist wunderhübsch eingerichtet und ist sehr ruhig und trotzdem zentral gelegen. Der Balkon wurde von uns fast jeden Tag zum Frühstück und zum Abendbrot genutzt und bietet mit dem Innenhof der umliegenden Häuser eine tolle Atmosphäre. Von der Wohnung aus ist Stockholm entweder zu Fuß oder mit den nahe gelegenen öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln toll zu erkunden. Eine tolle Unterkunft, die unbedingt zu empfehlen ist mit ganz liebenswerten und aufmerksamen Gastgeben. Vielen Dank nochmal an Eva und Alma.
Noch ein Tipp zum Parken: In der Nähe ist das Parkhaus \"Rosenlund\", in dem 24 h geparkt werden kann. Es macht Sinn, den Wagen dort für die Dauer des Aufenthaltes einzustellen und die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel zu nutzen."
"1593",1337420,43904895,2015-08-23,6766847,"Mark","The apartment was exactly as described/shown in the photos and felt like a home from home.  Great decor and artwork. Although in a complex of apartments, we found it to be a very quiet, pleasant and safe area. There is a park for walking/running across the road which goes down to the harbour and was a great place for a bit of late afternoon exercise and watching Stockholm enjoy the summer. It's a bit of a walk to the old city/city centre, but we used this to get to know the area and look for cafes/restaurants, so didn't mind.  Not too far to catch the metro and although we didn't use them, I think there must be buses very close by. We really recommend Eva's apartment."
"1594",1337420,44628921,2015-08-28,28828765,"Joy","Eva was at the apartment when we arrived and was very welcoming. It was easy to contact her in the time leading up to our stay. She made sure we knew how to work all the appliances, washing machine, etc. She also was very flexible with arrival and departure time, which helped us out a lot and we really appreciated. We had a little bit of a difficult time finding it because (Hidden by Airbnb) maps was not accurate. The apartment was spotless, bright and light - looked like the pictures.  It is on the 5th floor in a large apartment complex, but felt very private, safe and quiet in spite of this. Also, because of this, we felt we were staying in a real home with non-tourists all around us. We like to walk a lot, so we rarely used the public transport, and were easily able to get to Gamla Stan and many other Stockholm neighborhoods on foot, but the public transport is also nearby and easy to use.  This was a very good stay and I would recommend it to anyone."

El apartamento es tal y como se muestra en las fotos. Salon y cocina muy amplios, con todo lo necesario para pasar unos dias en Esfocolmo. Por ponerle un pero, diria que la habitacion es un poco incomoda para dos personas ya que la cama esta pegada a la pared por uno de los lados.
La madre del propietario nos atendio estupendamente. Nos facilito todas las instrucciones para llegar al apartamento y a nuestra llegada nos enseño el apartamento y como funcionaba todo. Fue muy amable mostrandonos y aconsejandonos los lugares de interes en Estocolmo.

The location is great, it's in a nice quiet and calm area of Södermalm but it's still very accessible. (Bus services directly outside the apartment and Skanstull T Bana station is only a 10 minute walk away) Even without public transport you can walk to Slussen in around 20 minutes. 
There are plenty of supermarkets and shops only a few minutes walk away too. Very convenient!

Eddie is a super nice guy who completely respects peoples privacy but is always incredibly helpful and very quick to respond if you have any questions at all before or during your stay. Eddie's advice about how to get to the apartment was great and very re-assuring for a first time solo traveller like myself!

All in all, a great place to stay if you are planning to stay in Stockholm and Södermalm in particular. Eddie is an amazing host and a credit to Air´BnB!

Beliggenheten på Södermalm er kjempebra med gangavstand til Gamla Stan og masse fine nisjebutikker og restauranter i SOFO i tillegg til parker, båter, museer og veldig nærme bussforbindelse til resten av Stockholm. 

En veldig bra leilighet for deg som virkelig vil kjenne på Stockholmspulsen og samtidig bo komfortabelt i et rolig område."

Beatiful vintage design , great vieuw over the city, very calm, nice neighbourhood with coffee bars and nice shops ! We enjoyed the cosiness of the appartment since the weather was not so good. Nina was a very helpful host. Beds were a little cramped for 5 adults but overall we had a great time here

She had champagne, cheese, milk, fruit in the fridge and everything clean and cozy for us.  Her apartment was perfect for us--I'm an interior designer and hate to say it, but the decor REALLY matters to me--and this apartment, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED!  The hard thing is that we came to see Stockholm and enjoy their restaurants, etc., but we really loved being at her apartment so much, it was hard to leave!  Started out around the dining room table in the early morning, smell of coffee on with cheese and bread on the table.  Such an experience!  Obviously Nina is an artist!  

The location itself is AMAZING!  We were able to park the car on the street for the weekend and walk to most everything.  The apartment felt very safe and we even met some of the neighbors as we came and went.  There is a park nearby and a interesting places to walk to.  We would recommend this apartment and Nina's hospitality 100%!

Thank you, Nina.  We will never forget this trip!!"

Mattias var väldigt vänlig och hade köpt frukost innan vi kom vilket gjorde det mycket enkelt att komma igång med tiden i Stockholm. Det enda mindre problemet var lite slarvig städning i badrummet men det inverkade på intet sätt till en sammantaget mycket positiv upplevelse. Jag skulle gärna bo här igen!"

It was easy to coordinate with Mattias to check in and he gave us a great overview of the apartment. There is one bed in the master good for 2 people and then two futons in the living room that could comfortably sleep 2 people as well.

The apartment was extremely clean and the kitchen was well stocked(pots, pans, immersion blender, etc) and we were able to make 2/3rds of our meals there. The Maxi ICA is close by. 

We were also able to do some laundry which was great because three of us ran the marathon there and were able to clean out clothes."

He even picked us up from the coach station and showing us the way to beach and supermarket in our arrival, making sure that we were well settled! His place is clean, cozy, and got everything we needed! We had a total of 5 people and it was just perfect for us! All kitchen ware that you may need are provided, and there are tea/ coffee/ bread/ ham/ eggs, etc well prepared in fridge! Toilet also has warmed up floor, washing/ drying machines, which was so helpful! The place is also well connected to the city centre by 2mins walk to bus station, and 10mins walk to subway, there are also supermarket and restaurants closed by. The best thing is, the beach and the lakeside path is just 2mins walk away, and you can enjoy the sunshine in the summer whenever you want! Would definitely come back again if I'm in Stockholm!

La casa rispecchia perfettamente la descrizione e le distanza dalla metro e dal centro. Il quartiere è tranquillo e in estate offre la possibilità di avere la \"spiaggia\" di Stockholm a due passi. Mattias è stata una persona gentile e pronta ad aiutarti. Per le prossime volte a Stockholm so già dove prenotare ;)"

Vi var meget glade for at bo der. Udenfor i fælles have sad vi og grille.  I græsset løb der vilde kaniner rundt. Skøn beliggenhed tæt på centrum og alligevel bor man ude i naturen. Dejligt nabolag, små villaveje med typisk svenske træhuse, store træer og buske ser blomstrede.
100 m væk ligger et libanesisk spisested med dejlig mad.
Det gik fint med at finde p-plads foran huset.
Hyggelig lejlighed, indrettet lidt specielt med passion for ældre møbelstil. Efter en lang dag som turist kunne vi savne en blød sofa at sidde i."

I felt so welcome—like I was at home! 
Her apartment is absolutely adorable – a very comfortable bed and decorated very well. I love her taste. This space is perfect for the solo traveler or couple. 
It was an easy walk to other parts of Södermalm. ~15-20 minutes to many spots around the neighborhood.

It was fun to explore the city with the bikes that she had since Stockholm is so bike friendly.  The neighborhood that we were in was convenient and close to everything.  The only downside of the apartment was the small bathroom.  The shower and toilet was in the same space (no separate tub to step into for showers) so I wasn't used to that.

We were instantly made to feel at home by our hosts - they are super nice and open people and always made sure we had everything we needed (from towels, cups and delicious breakfast and coffee in the morning). The room was great - impeccably clean, large, airy and sunny.

The location (Lilla Essingen) is also the perfect place to discover Stockholm from. It is a cute residential island that is still central and very well connected by public transport (we were surprised by how fast we could get to the central station, no more than 15 mins). There is also a beautiful running path by the water along the island and one of the greenest islands just across (Langholm) - you'll really enjoy it, if you want to experience the city but also like to have access to a bit of nature."

They always left a small light on for us when we came in later than they went to sleep :D.
Emelia and her family were extremely nice! They really made us feel welcome and at home! We sat in the kitchen and talked and Emelia gave us many valuable tips.

The next bus stop is 1 minute walk away and a bakery and grocery shop are literally across the street. Parks, water, running spots, city bikes and a lot more are also within 5 min distance.

Amaniel explained everything we needed to know and answered our (many) questions from where to buy basic supplies to travel questions.

He is really chilled out and laid back guy, and we had many good chats over the course of my three week stay. It was a pleasure to get to know him as a person.

The flat itself is wonderful, plenty of room and the kitchen was a big bonus. Like others have mentioned in the review, there's a big kitchen whereby guests have their own fridge/ freezer. I cooked every day I was there. The shower is powerful, and the room is big with comfy beds. The flat looks exactly as it does in the pictures. Other than that, the internet is fast and reliable, and the area is residential and safe. The flat is less than a 2 min walk from the subway, and from there it is about 16-18 mins to the centre of town. Sodermalm, the \"cool\" hipster area of Stockholm, is even closer. The tube runs throughout the night, so there is no issue  with getting back to the flat.

Beds are big and comfortable and the bathroom is very bright and nicely done. 

Paul and his girlfriend gave us a warm welcome, they also stayed at the apartment when we were there, so Paul helped us finding good cafes and shopping areas in the city and even called us a taxi when we had to go to the airport.

We enjoyed our stay at Paul's apartment very much, even if we would have wished it to be a bit cleaner (i.e. kitchen and bathroom towels)

The location is central, there is a good connection to the airport and metro station. The building is on the corner of to main streets, so you shouldn't leave the windows open at night :).

If you are looking for a spacious place with 3 bedrooms in a central area of town, this could be a good choice for you.

Aucune mauvaise surprise: le logement est tel que décrit sur le site. Sa situation est idéale, dans un quartier agréable, à la sortie du métro.
L'appartement est très lumineux, confortable. Il faut s'habituer à la lumière qui vous réveille à 3 heures du matin... En fonction de la saison bien sur.

Paul was at home when we arrived (very early) in the morning and showed us around his roomy apartment. We had three large bedrooms to stretch out in and plenty of space in the light-flooded living and dining rooms to visit with each other and organize our excursions. The kitchen was well-equipped, the washer-dryer combo in the hallway was a great convenience and the bathroom was a modern marvel. To top it all off, the subway was around the corner and a bus stop with many options was outside the door. Also: good restaurants and a gorgeous green park very nearby and a grocery store across the avenue."

Die Wohnung ist tatsächlich wie auf dem Portal beschrieben. Sehr nett, einladend und wir (3 Erwachsene und zwei größere Kinder) haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und hatten mehr als genügend Platz.
Wir haben alles Nötige vorgefunden (sogar Kaffee und Wein war für uns da!) konnten wunderbar in der herrlich kleinen, aber gut sortierten Küche kochen und der Esstisch hatte auch für uns alle Platz ! Die Metro ist in unmittelbarer Nähe und so gut getaktet, so dass wir wirklich sehr mobil waren und Ausflüge jederzeit unternommen werden konnten. Bäcker und Supermarkt befinden sich in der Nähe. Wir waren alle hellauf begeistert und würden Hannah auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen !!! Ganz begeistert waren wir, dass in der ges. Wohnung keine Uhr zu finden war !

We went from the flat on the t-bana (underground), then through central Stockholm through to Lidingo on the other side and it didn't take us more than 20 mins. To central Stockholm it's only 10 mins.  
Hanna had also provided for every thing that we needed for the stay.  She had also given us a hand written note with plenty of information and also usage of 4 cards for the underground.  The only thing that we missed was access to a washing machine given that we stayed there for 4 nights.  This would have been great.
Hanna was very responsive when whenever we had any questions etc.  Overall this was a great flat and we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this flat."

The flat itself was clean, warm and well-equipped, as well as tastefully decorated.

Our 4-year old daughter was very pleased with the children's room with a lot of toys to play with. Nice little cosy garden. A little bit of noise from the busy road nearby is the only downpoint. But on the other hand we had also the metro nearby which takes you in no time to the city.  The neighbourhood is also very residential and childfriendly with a new playground and square at 100 m. Very good bakery next door and supermarket at few hundred meters! 
We could use the bikes, very handy to discover the city:
Djurgarden, the shores around the city,... What a lot of beautiful parks. We also took the bikes to go swimming in the sjoderbyson-lake (only 15 min with bike, nature all around) and the Hellasgarden. Also the quiet park and cemetery skogskyrkogården is nearby.

It's situated within a young neighbourhood full of bars, shops, cafes, restaurants and the like. Contact was easy and Klara's replies always super fast plus she left great restaurant recommendations! The apartment is clean, calm and nicely done up and you'll easily feel comfortable.  Unfortunately it was a little chilly by the end of March and the central heating was just a tad too low. Apart from that it was a perfect stay!
Try the kanelbulle from the bakery between the flat and the station: they're fabulous!"

The apartment is easy to reach by public transport and looks exactly as in the pictures. The seating area is cosy, the kitchen very modern and stocked with everything one might need and the bed very comfortable (always a bonus!)
Whilst it might be a bit further from the center of Stockholm, it is super close to many lovely Södermalm cafés, delis, parks and bars, which is exactly what we were after. All in all we had a great stay and would definitely recommend Klara&Theo's place."

The apartment is about 2-3 minutes walk from Alvjo metro station , which is just 8-10 minutes by train from Stockholm Central station. The room was extremely comfortable and quite interestingly decorated with various small things included a collection of musical instruments of Johan , who is a fantastic musician himself. 
Kiana invited me to a concert where Johan was playing on the evening when I arrived in Stockholm and I had a great experience of Flamenco Guitar music performances by some of the finest in Sweden , including Johan himself (Would really thank Kiana for inviting me to the show).
The subsequent day, I also had the chance to meet with Johan's parents who were also very nice, warm and communicative.
The apartment had everything and more for a very comfortable stay.

The apartment is really like in the photos and the location is super close to the train station and it's only two/three stops from the centre. There is an elevator and there are no stairs, so it's super accesible.
The house has enough privacy not to make you uncomfortable that you are staying in someone else's home.

There is also a supermarket near by which is useful.
The neighborhood is very peaceful and pleasant with a lot of trees.
We highly recommend the place as it is a very good price for a very very nice place.

It is also close to Älvsjö station, which is on the line that goes straight to Stockholm centre and directly to Arlanda airport. So handy for everything really! On top of that, our hosts were just so welcoming and personable (Kiana even baked my girlfriend a birthday cake as it was her 30th while we were there!).

We were all so busy that was the only time we saw Johan.  We were often back late so did not meet Kiana.  The flat was comfortable and toast, cereal, juice. yoghurt. coffee etc was left for us to help ourselves.  We felt quite at home and relaxed.

The flat's on the third floor of a large estate of medium rise flats and is in quite a cosmopolitan area. It's very near the railway station

Am Tag unserer Ankunft hat uns Kiana an der Haltestelle abgeholt und uns die Umgebung erklärt, den Supermarkt gezeigt und anschließend nachhause gebracht. Sie haben sich jeden Tag darum gesorgt, dass es uns gut geht (auch wenn wir sie nicht oft gesehen haben). Jeden Morgen haben sie den Tisch liebevoll für uns gedeckt und wenn sie Zuhause waren haben sie mit uns geredet und uns Dinge gezeigt, die wir in Stockholm machen können. Alles in einem haben wir uns mehr als Willkommen gefühlt! Das Zimmer ist normal groß, hat ein großes Schlafsofa und einen Tisch. Auf dem Tisch liegen Reiseführer in allen möglichen Sprachen und Sim-Karten, falls man so etwas benötigt. Das Bad ist sehr sauber und ziemlich groß, die Dusche war sehr komfortabel und ebenfalls sauber. Die Nachbarschaft ist jetzt kein Highlight, in der Gegend gibt es eigentlich nichts ausser einen Supermarkt und Wohnhäuser, was aber kein Problem ist, da man mit dem Regionalzug/Sbahn, der in ca. 4 Minuten Fußweg zu erreichen ist, alle paar Minuten innerhalb von 10 Minuten in der Innenstadt ist.

The apartment is off an adorable little street in Gamla Stan (Old Town). It's a very convenient spot to explore the city from. We walked, caught the subway, & ordered Ubers to the other parts of the city easily. It's the perfect size for 2.

We are \"active sailors\" and used to \"unpack\" and \"stow aside\". Then the upper room worked fine and flexible, respectively living room, dining room and bedroom.

The apartment is as advertised, and Agneta was prompt and clear with directions.  Both the couch and the bed were comfortable, and the basement room is SILENT!  There is a small grocery just down the street, and there are plenty of cafés and restaurant options within steps of the apartment.  We would certainly recommend Agneta's apartment.

It's very close to all the old town attractions as well as walking distance to the ferry and other attractions outside of Gamla Stan. Also there is a metro station close by if you want to travel further afield and a public ferry is also within a couple of minutes walk which will take you to the ABBA museum, Skansen (a must visit), the amusement park, Vasa and the Nordic Museum. 

The apartment is of reasonable size and comfortable for two people but would not recommend for any more than two as the kitchen area and bathroom are compact and also would not recommend for anyone with mobility issues due to the narrow and tricky staircase down to the main bedroom. The bedroom is very large with a couch and chair for relaxation, the king size bed is super comfortable and as the bedroom is located in the basement it is very quiet and you are not woken by the early sunrise (we stayed in June) as was the case in other apartments we have stayed.

Her place is just perfect for two. If you are one who has trouble sleeping away from your own home, you'll find her big comfy bed a relief. The bedroom in the basement is dark, cool and very quiet. You need to be able to manage stairs, though. The bathroom is up on the main level. The location could not be better! Right in the center of Gamla Stan, but on a little side street away from the hustle and bustle. Would recommend for any able-bodied couple. Would definitely stay again!

She was very welcoming.
The place is both unique and exclusive.
A delightful, very old place, right in the middle of The Old Town.
Very stylishly decorated.
No noise at all despite being 10m from one of the main streets.
100m to the royal Palace.
Very memorable."

Die Unterkunft war ideal für zwei Personen, alles war perfekt organisiert. Das Schlafzimmer war absolut ruhig, der ganze Aufenthalt mehr als erholsam."
"2046",1634582,41936616,2015-08-10,22032664,"Peter","The apartment was as the description described it. We never came to know our host personally but the only question I posted to her was answered immediately.
It was our/my first experience with Airbnb and we liked it. The neighbourhood was central and and proofed to be one of the biggest feature of the apartment; everything was nearby and cycling we achieved to see much of Stockholm within the short timeframe we had."
"2047",1634582,42513673,2015-08-14,17625021,"Na","Agneta's apartment is charming, but it is not suitable for four people.  Especially if there are old people in your group.  The apartment has two bedrooms on two floors, and one floor is actually a basement.  The upstairs is small and the basement is large.  But the stairs to the basement is too steep for old people to climb.  These steps are also too steep and narrow to carry down large luggages.  The basement doesn't have restroom and WIFI.   So it could become difficult to assign rooms.   The kitchen can only accommodate one person at a time.  I could see that Agneta's room is perfect for an adult couple.   It is nicely decorated and is very clean.   The couple could leave luggages upstairs, and still have enough room.  They could sleep downstairs.   The downstairs bed is comfortable.  Agneta's apartment is reasonably priced for this location for two people.   It is conveniently located in the old town, close to the Palace, the Viking line and the old town square.   A couple could definitely have a very romantic and enjoyable time here."
"2048",1634582,43906076,2015-08-23,25800748,"Patrick","Agneta did everything to make the stay as easy as possible.  Everything was exactly as described; the location is perfect for visiting Gamla Stan and connecting to transportation to get to other parts of the city/archipelago.  Neighbor; what neighbor?"

"2051",1634582,49310846,2015-10-03,3089697,"Kerrie","If you love to stay in a historic location, this accommodation could be for you, tucked in a little cobbled laneway in Gamla Stan. A taxi can take you close to this quirky two-level apartment, or Central Station is a 20 minute walk. The apartment is ground floor level with a large quiet bedroom in the basement. As the stairs were steep, and the bathroom is ground floor level we left our luggage upstairs in the lounge.  The lounge is very comfortable and I believe is also a sofa bed. The  compact bathroom has a good shower and washing machine.  The kitchen is quite  tiny for cooking but has a cooktop and microwave.  There are plenty of nearby restaurants.  I would recommend Aifur Krog and Bar just for the experience."
"2052",1634582,49762141,2015-10-06,8670461,"Clare","The apartment is in a really nice area of the Old Town with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. It is really easy to get to other areas of Stockholm using the ferry or tram and Sodermalm is a short walk away. The instructions from Agneta were very clear and when we met her she was very helpful. The apartment itself is a little bit small and it is a shame that the downstairs doesn't have any windows but the whole place does have a lot of character. I wouldn't stay here with more than two people."
"2053",1634582,50740162,2015-10-14,8699702,"Alison","Agneta was a wonderful hostess -- she sent very clear instructions for accessing the apartment, and she responded quickly when we had a question. The apartment is lovely. Both the regular bed and the sofa bed were comfortable, the bathroom is amazingly easy to use despite its small size (the shower is especially roomy), and my mother, daughter, and I very much looked for ward to returning to the apartment each day. It is perfectly located in Gamla Stan, within easy walking distance of wonderful restaurants, numerous shops, the water front, and transportation. We could not imagine a better place to stay!  We will certainly return should we visit Stockholm again. Thank you!!!"

Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und uns in der Wohnung wohl gefühlt. Sie ist sehr gemütlich eingerichtet und mit allem Notwendigen (Badetücher, Kaffee, Tee usw.) ausgerüstet, was wir sehr geschätzt haben. Alles ist sauber und die Lage sehr zentral, man kann von da aus ganz viel gut zu Fuss erreichen. Die Wohnung ist im Erdgeschoss eines alten Hauses und das Schlafzimmer Gewölbekeller, wo es sehr ruhig ist - und vielleicht ein bisschen dunkel. Bei der Buchung haben wir eine Mail mit allen wichtigen Infos erhalten (Anreise, Schlüssel usw.).

"2058",1634582,53484791,2015-11-09,39508935,"Margareta","Otroligt fin lägenhet i en lugn gränd i gamla stan. Man sover helt ostört. Passar perfekt för 2 personer. Mysfaktorn är hög eftersom ägarinnan möblerat smakfullt och personligt. Allt är genomtänkt in i minsta detalj. Köket är mycket litet. Passar för att göra frukost eller en enkel måltid. Lägenheten ligger strategiskt med promenadavstånd till det mesta i city. Perfekt med en mataffär ( coop nära ) 4 minuter från lägenheten. Om Du har svårt att gå i trappor passar lägenheten inte dig. Ganska brant och trixig trappa ned till sovrummet. Bäddsoffan är inte bekväm så om ni behöver mer än en säng funkar det inte så bra. Dubbelsängen i sovrummet är dock oerhört bra med härliga täcken, kuddar och sängkläder. Det var jätte lätt att hitta hit och vi fick mycket bra instruktioner. Ägarinnan hälsade på oss kort efter ankomst och var mycket trevlig."
"2059",1634582,54101312,2015-11-16,43726155,"Joshua","Listing was absolutely accurate as a cozy but spacious apartment in the heart of Gamla Stan. Having previously lived in the area several years prior, Agneta's apartment was everything a former resident or new tourist could ever want in a home away from home. Furnishings were excellent and the apartment was well stocked with basics such as dish soap, towels, linens, cooking utensils, washer/dryer, hair dryer etc. Even after we had checked in we had run a little low on toilet paper and just before I ran to the shop to purchase some more, a new package was left by our doorstep. Overall we are very satisfied with our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone with one exception. As mentioned in a previous review, the stairs leading down from the main living area (ground level) to the bedroom are a bit steep/uneven. While this should be expected for medieval architecture (the building dates from the 1400s I believe), it may be a bit much for older/handicapped visitors and though it was no problem for a couple of newlyweds, it may be a concern to others. That being said, we did note a lift leading down to the bedroom, but we are not sure if it was functioning. Overall, a splendid experience! We would love to stay again!"
"2060",1634582,55350165,2015-12-01,40832911,"Kara","This location is very central, a short walk from the central station, and Gamla Stan the island has a Tunnelana (metro) stop. Lilla Hoparegrand is a quiet alleyway off a main thoroughfare through the island. The building is secure. Agneta is well organized to have two people welcomed to her apartment. It is split between two levels: bedroom by way of narrow steep bedrock stairs on the level below, living room, kitchen, and bathroom above. It was super charming for our honeymoon, but perhaps thankfully cooking in the space for the kitchen was not an option. Early winter in Stockholm is a magical time of year."

Das Zimmer ist sehr ansprechend eingerichtet,  sehr sauber, verfügt über ein eigenes Bad und sehr bequeme Betten und ist ruhig gelegen. Noch viel tollere war jedoch die Gastgeberin!! Marina hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen, wir haben uns sofort wie zu Hause gefühlt :-)! Obwohl wir nur eine Nacht geblieben sind, hat sie sich Zeit genommen und wir haben uns sehr angeregt unterhalten. Sie und ihre Tochter haben uns  super Tipps gegeben, wo wir Abendessen und Frühstücken gehen können. Außerdem durften wir unser Gepäck netterweise nach dem Auschecken noch den ganzen Tag in ihrer Wohnung lassen. Ich würde diese Unterkunft definitiv weiter empfehlen!!"

And the room is exactly the same as it is described. The beds are comfortable and everything is clean. The location is also great, just around 10minutes of walking from the central station. There are also some cafe and restaurants which you can find on some guide books around her place. I would highly recommend her house!"

The room was excellent; bright, clean and tidy with lots of space for two people, as well as our own bathroom plus shower! There were also lots of guidebooks and maps in the room which were really helpful :) The kitchen is fine for a few days, well-stocked with pots/pans but the oven is a little difficult to use if you are not used to a gas-fire oven!

The place is right in the centre, maximum 10 minutes walk to the main station (and not much further to the Old Town) but doesn't feel unsafe or noisy at all. There is a large supermarket (Co-op) very close by where you can buy lots of groceries etc if needs be.

Rauhallinen ilmapiiri ja kodikas tunnelma, saivat tuntemaan tervetulleeksi. Sängyt olivat todella pehmeät ja ikkunasta avautuivat näkymät sisäpihalle rauhaisaan puistoon. Huoneessa oli oma kylpyhuone, joka oli siisti ja moderni suihkuineen. Lentomme saapui Tukholmaan aikaisin aamulla, joten oli kiva yllätys saada huone jo ennen klo 13. Marina majoittajana oli hyvin avulias ja ihana, tuntui kuin olisimme tunteneet hänet aina! Sijainti oli aivan ostoskadun Drottninggatanin lähellä, josta oli lyhyt kävelymatka keskustaan sekä juna- ja bussiterminaaleihin.

Detta var en väldigt positiv överraskning och det funkade superbra att bo där såpass länge då det finns både diskmaskin och tvättmaskin. Lägenheten har en jättestor, fin balkong som är perfekt att sitta på när det är fint väder, sol hela eftermiddagen/kvällen.

The place is right next to commuter train station which we were not aware we could use with our day pass.

Luckily, we didn't run into any situation fighting for the bathroom.  We did get to meet Marcus.  He is very friendly.

It was very convenient for me because I was attending a conference in the south of the city (Stockholmmassan conference centre) . The train line, which is just 1min away from the flat, also directly links Arlanda, the international airport. There are buses to take you to the city centre. There is a small Coop shop round the corner, very convenient. 
Marcus was very organised to give everyone access at any time of the day and very responsive to emails. I actually only saw him 3sec one morning out of the 7 days I was there. The flat has indeed no communal area where you might encounter Marcus or other people, so that makes it very cold and impersonal, quite far from the original AirBnB ideal, much more like a hotel. And obviously you can see from the pictures that there is no fabulously cool Swedish style in the room/flat. The direct area around the flat isn't great but there are lovely independent cafes a few blocks away.

From the time my booking was accepted to the end of my stay, I had a very positive and pleasant experience. Marcus' instructions and directions from the airport were very clear. The flat is very conveniently located, about 50 metres from the train station. Even with heavy luggage, the location is just perfect.

The neighbourhood is quiet and peaceful with plenty of restaurants and pubs on your doorstep. The bus stop is also by the station with frequent buses passing all the time. The flat is 1 station away from Central Stockholm, less than 5 minutes train ride. 

I found the flat to be very clean and everything well organised. The room I occupied was of a reasonable size with a desk and space to hang my clothes and pack my suitcase away. For those who love quiet and tranquil spaces, the flat is very ideal. Good for working, reading and just relaxing in a quiet environment. 

Overall, my stay was great and I would use Marcus' place again when I visit Stockholm in the future."

The Room itself was very nice with a couch and a big bed. The rest of the flat was also ok. Nothing fancy but it does the trick. Also it is situated in the heart of Söder with good connections to the other parts of the city and Arlanda airport. 
I met Marcus only twice and very briefly. It wasn't the interaction I experienced from other hosts, which is disappointing. 
Overall it felt more like a slightly better hostel (especially since he is renting out two more rooms). If you are just looking for a somewhat less expensive room with a good location this is a good find."

The location is good, walkable distance to the main street with lots of cafes and shops. Marcus and Peter were very kind in waiting up for our late arrival, and were generally friendly in our few interactions. However, if you are looking to experience a more \"authentic\" Swedish home experience, then this may not be for you. Firstly, there was some work being done to the kitchen and the living room, which meant that we didn't see much of our hosts and that we were mostly confined to our room. Secondly, we didn't realise that the flat was kind of like a hostel, with guests in other rooms. We didn't mind it so much as we weren't there for long and spent most of our days in the city, but this may be something to consider!"

Fun story: My friend was feeling sick and Marcus knew of three different places to go for some supplies and drew me a route on a map. Not to mention the variety of brochures loaded with good information on how to best enjoy the city! Not only that, we were literally a stone's throw away from a local shopping district, a theatre (where we enjoyed a Nate Ruess concert), and so many subway stops that all of Stockholm is literally accessible from our front door!"

We came in via a night train so even though we arrived early in the morning Marcus graciously gave us a key and let us drop off our bags. He even put our bags inside the room while we were out sightseeing.

The only con was there is no common area to sit and relax. For us that was not an issue as we ate out and did not spend much in the apartment."

The first aid kit even came in handy because I was sick. Very clean. Lovely place with a cafe downstairs and restaurants and grocery store nearby."

His flat is very well-located. We bought a 3 day travel pass which we did not end up using that much of as it was very central. Sodermalm is an easy and pleasant walk away where we went out for drinks and dinner. It is also close to Gamla Stan. Marcus has 3 rooms in his flat for the guests and his own room. All the doors can be locked with a passcode which makes it very secure. Bathroom is functional and kitchen although haven't used is usable. 

to summary, its a modern flat that is well located in a safe neighbourhood. Would recommend."

It felt a little more like a motel than a bnb. 3 rooms rented out and no shared room meant that you never saw the other guests and never got that airbnb \"feeling/experience\". But again, depends on what you want through airbnb:)"

We just stayed one night, and for that time the room was perfect. When we plan to stay longer the next time we come to Stockholm, we would search for a place that is a little less crowdy and narrow. The bathroom wasn't that clean, but it wasn't that important to us.
We didn't meet Marcus personally, but he always was very helpful and answered questions very quickly."

Before I booked, I was a little worried about some reviews that mentioned the bathroom situation was less than ideal. However, I can only speak for myself, and I had zero problems. The bathrooms were clean during the time I was there, and I didn't have to wait to use them. In case it isn't clear from the ad, the place is less like a regular home, and more like a place which has been prepared to receive guests, but in the best way possible (e.g. the bedroom doors have electronic locks with codes, etc.). If what you want is maximum interaction with the host, old school kind of thing, look elsewhere. But if you want to stay in a great location in Stockholm at an affordable price and hassle free, I highly recommend this place."

The information provided by Marcus and the updates he gives us regarding his schedule were comprehensible and timely.
The apartment is very secure, clean and has the necessities that you need such as hot water kettle, utensils, crockery, toliet rolls and bath towels.
The house rules he lays down are simple and easy to follow.
There is also the off chance that there would be other tenants at his place, so if you like to make new friends, this is another good opportunity too."

We were surprised by a handful of things, overall unimpressed, and struggled to understand how there are so many positive reviews considering the price compared to the value. We would have preferred staying in a youth hostel, where we would have had all the things this place lacked. This is the first negative review I have left on AirBNB, and I have stayed at 24 places through AirBNB. We didn’t care for our arrival. We had directions to let ourselves in and then to find out, Marcus was there the whole time. Every other host where I have stayed has greeted us and showed us the place. We were two male friends, as I let him know in my communication, yet the bed was made up as a double for a couple. We don’t know why he assumed we were a couple. As we did not believe he was home, we separated the beds ourselves. We feel that the listing is deceptive for several reasons. 1) The listing does not inform you that there are a total of three rooms that are booked to guests and that the bathrooms are shared with guests from all three rooms, plus the host also uses the same bathrooms. One night there were a total of 8 guests, plus the host, makes 9 people that were using the bathrooms. People had to wait to take a shower or use the toilet. I discovered the other listings after we had booked the place, and initially thought it would have been nice to meet other people, but there are no common rooms such as a living room or dining room to spend your time in, just the bedrooms! 2) As indicated above, there are no common rooms such as a living room or dining room. This is the first place I have stayed through AirBNB that didn’t have these spaces. There aren’t photos of them, but we felt it should have been specifically clarified in the written description, same as that there are three rooms all booked to guests. It was hard to really interact with other guests, as there was nowhere to do that. The only common space is the hallway and the kitchenette that is part of the hallway to one side. 3) The kitchenette is described as a kitchen, but it is very minimal and for something like this it should be described as a kitchenette. There is nothing other than what shown in the photo. We would have expected some area to do food prep, but there isn’t. And with three rooms of guests all sharing the kitchenette, it is much different that you would expect. The photos could be more revealing of what the place is like, but don’t show a photo from the entry looking down the hallway, so you can see what the place is like and the size of the..."

I only met Marcus briefly after we arrived, but he seemed nice and gave all the necessary information beforehand."

One little minus: there are several rooms rented for airbnb and not all are as big as described and it can get a bit tight if there are 3 people living in it. However, this is not really relevant as you most probably will be there only for sleeping"

"2287",1665248,52347468,2015-10-28,679097,"Cecilia","We had a very pleasant stay at Marcus's place, which I think has some advantages and disadvantages in equal measure. To quickly summarize, the advantages are price and location, and the disadvantages are space and what I'll call the \"hostel atmosphere.\" Marcus wasn't in town while we were there, but communication was very clear in advance, so we didn't have any issues getting in or out. The room is quite comfortable (especially the beds), but I would be reluctant to call it BIG in all caps. We had to shimmy our suitcases where we could to make them fit so we could move around freely. It isn't mentioned in the description, but the room is one of (I think) 3 guest rooms in the place, which share 2 bathrooms. I suppose there is nothing deceptive in the listing about this, but it isn't what I expected from my previous experiences with Airbnb, and it does lend the place the atmosphere more of a comfortable hostel than an Airbnb, let alone a hotel. All this said, the great advantage of this place is the location. It's just across from a commuter train station, which makes getting in and out of the city a snap, and it's also within a very close walking distance of some lovely shops and cafes, as well as the historic city center. The street itself is calm and residential, and we loved getting to know our little corner of Stockholm!"

We shared the little bathroom (shower, one toilet in same bathroom) amongst the 3 rooms. While we never physically met Peter, he was very responsive and helpfull. Good location close to metro and city center. There is a lot of traffic in the road which makes it noisy when opening the windows (however really thick glasses do isolate well)."

The shower is very bare bone, the water remains on the floor and first day when we arrived, the bathroom was smelly (on the second day it was cleaned). I would say it was adequate, but perhaps one can find a better value place in Stockholm."

"2323",1667100,35369188,2015-06-18,28072610,"Deryn","When we arrived very late at the address, we were dismayed to find that the room we had booked and prepaid for 13 nights bore little resemblance to the advertised picture, and the whole place was very grubby.  Peter was not able to come round that night till after 11.30 to discuss the issues, so it was a very unfortunate beginning.  The next day he did remedy this situation and sort the room out, cleaning up the kitchen and shared bathroom as well.  As all 3 rooms were let out almost all the time, there was considerable pressure on the one bathroom, and guests are at the mercy of any inconsiderate house-mates - we had a couple of bad experiences with this although we met several very compatible people. In the end, despite these hassles, the room did suit our purposes and was pleasant to spend time in. The neighbourhood is very convenient and congenial - handy to transport and amenities.  We liked Kungsholmen very much.  It was our first Airbnb experience and we will learn from this."

We loved that a supermarket was just around the corner from the apartment. Everything was perfect, except for one thing: cleanliness. Now, it wasn't extremely dirty by any means, but it certainly needs some more attention. Maybe this has to do with the fact that there are three Airbnb rooms in the apartment and one bathroom and kitchen? Like I said, we really enjoyed everything about our stay, but the cleanliness definitely needs to be improved a bit."

Let's be positive and forget about the fact that there is no living room in the apartment (three bedrooms for a minimum of 8 persons, a kitchen - not very clean - and one bathroom; where does the host live?), that we were kindly requested to change the bed sheets ourselves (on arrival), that we had to clean our room ourselves (on arrival), that there was no toilet paper for a day or so, that we never met our host (apparently too busy elsewhere): the metro station is nearby, as are a couple of supermarkets, you can get good coffee in the area, the weather was nice and Stockholm is worthwhile visiting. Do you want to know our recommendation? On balance: negative."

Everything Was as good as described, and the view of the river near Peter's place was  very beautiful. If there will be a trip to Stockholm again, I would love to live there and invite Peter to try our hot-pot."
"2337",1667100,43363482,2015-08-19,29894967,"Jennifer","NO TOILET PAPER! Bought our own.*
Shared kitchen/bathroom with three rooms. Host is NOT on-site.

Peter's communication was extremely fast pre-booking and nearly non-existent after booking. STRICT cancellation policy.

LOCATION is great. Easy transportation access; City Center 25-minute walk. Grocery, apothecary, coffee shop within block.

ROOM has great windows directly above street/nightlife (*loud*). Room was living room; has shared door with kitchen. Beds are comfortable. The full/queen bed is two single beds; one taller than the other and a chasm between them. More storage than necessary. Room's glass door has curtain for privacy but handle could fall off at any moment.

KITCHEN's stocked with kettle, oven, microwave, pots/pans, spices; plenty of glasses, plates, and cutlery which are stored on the counter and dirty. Like the refrigerator, the stocked pantry could use a scrubbing and regular cleaning. Refrigerator leaks water (cracked flooring=leaking a long time) and often difficult to open (use a knife to break the seal).

BATHROOM is SHARED. Other guests may not have the same consideration level as you. Shower=right side of bathroom and is simply divided by a shower curtain (not seen, picture 5/9). A squeegee's available to dry floor. Surprised how many guests left floor COMPLETELY wet (puddles!) and hair in drain. Awful.

OVERALL, stay was tolerable if you're OK with dirty conditions that won't improve unless it's done yourself.

COMMUNICATION
Peter was quick to reply when first contacted (3 months before the booking). He provided information about airport transportation. When building door code changed, he updated us.
The week before the reservation, I sent Peter messages regarding our arrival and inquired about the time when we could access the room. No reply. A few days before reservation, I sent another email. Peter's response said my questions were answered in previous correspondence (they weren't).
When we arrived in Stockholm in the early morning, I messaged again to ask when we could access the room. No response. Another message later in the afternoon went without response. We went to the apartment after 1800. The room was not refreshed, so we found sheets and towels on our own. Peter came by about an hour later and offered to make the beds, but we had already made them ourselves. We commented to Peter about how hot the room was and he was kind enough to bring a fan out for us.

* At 0655, I advised Peter via email that toilet paper was down to one roll (three were used the day before). Someone (perhaps Peter) came to the apartment later during the day to collect the 3-day-old kitchen garbage and refresh some rooms, but NO TOILET PAPER was brought. When we returned for the day, there was no toilet paper. I emailed Peter again at 1844. No response. Later that night, we went to the store ourselves to purchase some for the apartment (as well as the other guests) then I emailed Peter to tell him. No response. That's right: WE BOUGHT OUR OWN TOILET PAPER.

The bathroom clogged once when we were there and completely flooded.

With a very spacious room on offer as well as access to everything you could need or want in his home, Peter also assisted with reserving the laundry for washing which was truly appreciated. The apartment is centrally located within downtown Stockholm, a few minutes walk from the metro, and approximately 15 minutes from Gamla Stan (the old town).

A tip for visiting Stockholm: You can buy an \"access\" card for either 24, 48, or 72 hours. It gives you full access not only to ride busses, light rails, and the metro, but also allows you to ride several ferries for free, which was great!"

only little downside could be that from the foto's one could think that the entire appartment   was for rent, while it's just the bedroom. no complaints."

In addition to the comforts of two bedrooms, two bathrooms and fully-equipped kitchen, the location was wonderful. Very short walk to nice shopping, restaurants, groceries, nightlife, and the metro station. We also found our way down to the waterfront which provides a great place for running virtually around the whole island.

The kitchen had everything basic you might need. The bed was comfortable, but the mattress was pretty saggy, though I slept just fine. The only problem was the sofa as a sleeping place, because it was very saggy and my friend couldn't sleep all too well. 
Especially the short walk to the tunelbanan station was great, but you could also walk easily to Gamla Stan. Södermalm in general is a great neighborhood with many restaurants and shop.

He basically left us his appartment with food in the refrigerator and toiletries to use. Our son had great fun playing with the toys of Frank's son. The small apartement is in a quiet neighbourhood but well connected to the centre. As it was very cold in Stockhom during our stay, unfortunately the heating couldn't cope with the temperatures and the appartement could have been warmer for us.

Frank was helpful and told us not to hesitate if we had any questions. The location is quite good, the Creperie around the corner (there is also a kids corner) is worth a visit.
The apartment (ground floor) is a bit noisy because it is next to a busy street. The 4th mattress was dirty and saggy and should be replaced. The others were in perfect condition. There is no door between the childs room and the living room. We thought there would be one, but we did not ask Frank beforehand so it is our fault but it would be worth a remark in the description.

He was available if we needed him but otherwise wasn't checking up on us. My 4 year old loved playing with Franks sons toys which made his holiday lots of fun! 

The apartment is well stocked with things and Frank provided us with some first day provisions. One thing for people to note is that the apartment consists of a hallway, bathroom, kitchen, a small childrens room and a large main room which contains the double bed, TV and dining table. It was fine for our needs as a family of 4 but if you are 4 people who want some privacy from each other then it probably isn't the place! 

Would happily stay again.

The apartment  was in a fantastic location - very easy to access the whole of Stockholm, and very conveniently located near the Skanstall train station.
We spent a good hour talking with Frank and he gave us his recommendations on where we should visit around Stockholm. 

A fantastic trip all in all, made even better by the perfect host. Airbnb experience at its finest!"

Frank was a great host who met us at the central station to exchange the keys during his work day and who provided us with lots of local information. His response time to queries was always very prompt. He also provided us with a stocked fridge to use whatever we wanted which was just great especially when travelling! He also had a baby cot and high chair for our baby.

Frank's place was perfect for us with young kids as our eldest son loved playing with all of Frank's son's toys and he also loved the fantastic playground very close by. The apartment was also centrally located in a great area and also suitable for those without kids as there were lots of restaurants and funky bars etc to frequent. We would stay there again."

Frank was very welcoming, gave us lots of good advice, and left snacks for our kids. Our young children also really enjoyed the toys (and the Spider-Man art, of course!). Throughout our stay Frank was easy to communicate with and even helped us get a taxi with 5 minutes notice. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again!"

Frank mødte os i lejligheden, da vi ankom, hvor han tog sig god tid til at sætte os ind i Stockholms sights, offentlig transport, lokale legepladser osv. Hans mantra var \"feel like home\" - og det gjorde vi så. Lejligheden ligger dejligt centralt og er perfekt til familier med små børn. Vores unger satte stor pris på legetøjet i lejligheden, badekaret og en super god legeplads i nærheden. Vi ville klart bo der igen!"

The room is big, very cosy and the bed very comfortable. 
I think it has the best location, there is a lot of trendy shops, restaurants and nice cafes nearby, parks and an amazing sight point of all Stockholm! It is a young and boho neighborhood, many cool places all around, and close to Gamla Stan (by foot). 
Jonas made my friend and I feel at home, he is very helpful, available and I loved talking in the kitchen with him about art, fashion or different cultures. He definitely made our stay even better. And that's why I recommend him and his apartment!"

1. His place does not only stays at the very  center of the city. The place is also located on a small hill by the lake that you can get a perfect view of the Old Town and the city hall and the lake. 
2. His place is also very close to a good supermarket, which is perfect for the people that are afraid of the expensive supper in Stockholm. 

Jonas is a very friendly host and tells you a lot about the city. That will make you comfortable for the staying. Recommend for everybody!"

Apartment is very close to centre - 5 min to subway (tunnelbana - cool word) and 15 min to Central Railway Station (T-centralen).

Excellent séjour !"

Mi ha anche aiutato nei casi in cui avevo domande o dubbi sulla città o sul funzionamento di qualche cosa nell'appartamento. Inoltre l'appartamento è molto comodo da raggiungere, e di conseguenza è anche molto comodo spostarsi per la città da lì, sia con la metro che a piedi o in bicicletta. La stanza singola dove ho alloggiato è confortevole ed ha costituito un buon \"rifugio\" dove tornare nelle ore più fredde. :) Mi sono trovato bene anche quando l'altra stanza era occupata, nonostante all'inizio avessi pensato che ci saremmo stati stretti, mi sono accorto che l'appartamento di Maud riesce ad accogliere benissimo 3 persone. Anche per fare la spesa ci sono due supermarket di diverse dimensione davvero vicini.
Grazie mille, Maud! 
Spero di riuscire a tornare presto!"

The place is in a awesome location because it's a quite neighborhood with lots of green areas but also is 5 min to tunnelbana, and 10 to the t-centralen (the city center) by subway. 
Maud is always paying attention to little details in order to everything be perfect for your stay in her house.
The two little cats are lovely, If you don't like cats its no problem, most of the time they are sleeping and you barely see them.
In summary, I totally recommend you to stay on this place during your stay in Stockholm."

The street where the apartment is quiet and there are  supermarket in the corner and  restaurants . The  streets around with lively trade. 
We did not see Ami because she was on vacation. Her neighbor met us when we arrived in one o'clock at  night.
The apartment is nice and comfortable  and we managed it very well.

Ci ha aspettate sveglia fino a tardi perché il nostro volo arrivava all'aeroporto di Skavsta, quindi ci abbiamo messo un po' per raggiungere la casa. Tutto era esattamente come era stato descritto. Molto pulito e accogliente. Alice ci preparava le tazze della colazione nella loro bellissima cucina, un piacere svegliarsi e rimanere un po' lì prima di uscire. La zona è molto silenziosa e anche se di primo impatto può sembrare lontana dalla città vecchia, dopo un paio di tragitti a piedi ci si rende conto che sono solo 10 minuti a piedi.

Het schattige appartement van Charlotta ligt in Södermalm, een upcoming buurt met veel leuke cafés en restaurants. Met de metro (halte is nog geen 100 meter lopen) ben je binnen 10 minuten in het hart van Stockholm. De plek vonden wij perfect, omdat je in de wijk leuk kunt wandelen en winkelen en toch snel in de stad bent.

Charlotta's huisje is klein maar fijn en met veel smaak (Scandinavisch natuurlijk) ingericht. Met twee personen heb je precies genoeg ruimte. Na twee nachten besloten we in plaats van het bed de slaapbank te gebruiken, die een stuk comfortabeler ligt. Niets op aan te merken verder!"

Anna's apartment was wonderful and spacious with the most divine balcony to enjoy a sunbathed breakfast! The location is so great, so much so close around us. One thing to note was the fact that perhaps as a miscommunication, in Australia we call a 'sofa bed' one that pulls out but this is just a wide sofa to sleep on. Just to be aware if you are staying as a 3. But all in all it was great stay and we loved our time in Stockholm!"

All convenience shops are within walking distance including a great supermarket for supplies. Still it is very quiet, in a peaceful niche.

That would be fine, but I'd stay in his apartment, which turned out to be exactly as described by Peter and reviewers. Big king-sized bed, a full kitchen (and we cooked every night), modern decor (see photos), very large bedroom, great TV sound system, five minutes from the metro (really), really good eateries nearby, etc. And he was there to meet us when we arrived: as I suggested above, a wonderfully talkative yet serious young host who we hope to see again next summer."

Stefan er yderst behagelig og imødekommende som person, så vi følte os rigtig godt modtaget. Alle informationer om huset og omgivelserne blev til fulde imødekommet.

We are a family of four and had lots of space (more than enough). The terasse is great for having dinners 7 barbecues outside (with a fixed installed grill station). The garden is nice and of course there is a trampoline for the kids. The lake is just over the fence for swiming and a small beach nearby. Travelling to downtown is convenient (bus station right outside the door), but takes around 35-40 min.
Definitely a great place for families, that want to get some nature. If you look for the Stockholm downtown experience with tons of restaurants around the corner maybe not the ideal place, but feasible as well.
Really nice and laid back hosts! Thanks a lot for having us at your place! Would love to come back..."

I contacted her numerous times with various questions.  She always answered promptly and thoughtfully.  When we arrived at the house she and her husband explained how some of the features of the house work.  I had more questions for Anna during our stay.  She was, once again, great about responding.  The house is as nice as the pictures indicate.  Of course, the kitchen and dining room are the stars of the house.  That is where we spent the vast majority of our time.  The whole house was extremely clean and highly functional.  We comfortably had 6 people stay in the house.  The neighborhood is really cool.  It is a quaint residential area with very limited traffic.  The houses are all very nice.  The house is a short walk from two T-bana stations and two grocery stores.  The train ride into town is faster than you would think just looking at a map.  We were in Stockholm in no time; it helps that the T-bana is an amazing subway system.  If we ever make it back to Stockholm we will definitely stay at Anna's place again even if we don't have a large group.  It was that enjoyable."

We spent most of our time at the house either in the kitchen or in the garden, and we had some wonderful meals and times there. We really got to enjoy  the garden and the patio because of the nice weather, and even had some deer \"visiting\". It was nice with all the light in the kitchen, and it was good that we could open some of the windows while we were home since it was so warm, Anna warned us to do that in advance. We also enjoyed her Nespresso machine,(We brought our own pods.) The house was perfect to park the car and to walk to the T-banan, we also tried the pendeltog from stockholmsmessan, and even the bus back a night the T-banan had closed. It was very convenient to have a 5 day unlimited SL-ticket for all the public transportation. The washer/dryer was convenient for those in our company that was continuing their journey in Europe. We also got to try the kebab pizza at Tallkrogan pizza (no delivery possible, pick-up only), though they had a hard time with finding someone that spoke English on the phone, so it was convenient for them that I could switch to Norwegian. This was one of the few nearby take-out places that Anna suggested for us in advance, though take-out is not so common in Scandinavia. We also tried  We used the Grocery store Lidl while we were there and we can recommend the fresh bread and the ice cream there. Since it was so warm when we were there we asked Anna for the nearest beaches which she provided the information for and extra towels, pick-nick blanket and a camping-chair, but we never had time to go."

We loved the spacious kitchen dining area.  It was an easy walk to the T Bahn and we felt at home exploring stunning Stockholm knowing we had such a comfortable base. Thank you Anna"

La maison d'Anna est un havre de bien être, environnement très plaisant, calme, tout en étant très proche du centre de Stockholm.
Anna nous avait fournit toutes les explications de façon très claires.
Nous recommandons vivement cette location."

We had easy access to the metro.
We loved being out of the city area and in a quiet neighbourhood, close to a grocery store and lovely pizza shop."

Ulrike is a very friendly host and knows the city of Stockholm quite well. If you got any questions, you could always come up to her and she gladly gave advice. She also provides guests with lots of information about the most common places in the city. 
The room has a douplebed, a small table + chair and big wardrope (very good if you bring lots of cloths). Room is bright, because two big windows, but in total not very huge (~10-12 m2). 
Kitchen includes everything you need to cook. Basic stuff (salt, pepper,etc.) is shared. Bathroom was a little bit old, but will renovated in June/July 2015. When I was there was only one shower (had no problem with sharing the shower altough sometimes more than 6 or 7 peopled stayed at the house), but in the new bathroom there will be a second one."

She showed me many places to visit, sometimes we ate together and I could lend a bicycle. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. As described, the house is in the suburbs, but the city can be reached in under half an hour. There is even a beach (yes, with sand!) nearby. I can only recommend to stay with Ulrike."

We were 5 adults - 2 couples and a friend, and there was plenty of room. The area was great, walking distance to a hill with the best view of Stockholm where we watched the sun set with the locals. There was also a great shopping centre with cool independent shops and cafes, big chain stores and a great couple of bars. The tube station was a 2 minute walk so we travelled to different parts of Stockholm no trouble and got the airport shuttle direct to and from Arlanda from there too - this was all with the help of Lina's directions and guidance. We had a wonderful time and would certainly recommend this apartment and Lina as a host, for both families, groups and couples."

The location is in the trendy island of Södermalm and the apartment itself is right in front of a bus stop and a short walk to a metro station, making it easy to get to the city centre. The neighbourhood is very nice, being near a park and all. We didn't meet Lina but she arranged everything very well for our check-in. Check out was easy. Lovely stay."
"2639",2015509,44404692,2015-08-26,12195961,"Alan","We (my wife, her three cousins and I) had a fabulous time staying in Lina's apartment for nine nights. It was the first trip to Stockholm for all of us, and having an apartment enhanced our experience significantly. 

Lina was very communicative with us and gave us excellent instructions on how to get to the apartment (very close to the subway). A representative from the firm she uses to help manage her bookings was at the apartment within five minutes of the appointed time, and gave us thorough instructions about the apartment. It was a very businesslike and efficient hand-off.

The apartment is more than large. It consists of five spacious rooms, set up in a fanlike arrangement, wrapping around the front corner of the second floor (US nomenclature), with a kitchen looking onto the courtyard. There is one full bathroom, containing the washing machine, and a small WC. With the windows open, there was a delightful breeze throughout the apartment.

The two main bedrooms are at opposite ends of the apartment, so my snoring did not bother our cousins. Sheets, duvets and towels were supplied in abundance. The furnishings are in modern Scandinavian style, with nice photos on the walls (including two very large, and very interesting images taken by Lina). This gave it a very warm and personal, rather than institutional, feeling.The dining room table seats up to ten people. A large couch in the living room can also serve as a bed. The shelves contain plenty of books, including an entire shelf of Lonely Planet travel guides. 

Though the kitchen is roomy and well appointed, with new major appliances, we wound up having only our breakfasts at home, as the food scene in Stockholm' s restaurants is world class. Lina had most of what we needed for this purpose already on hand, so we only needed to shop for a few fresh items. The only kitchen appliance we missed having was a toaster. 

The apartment is in a quiet, but by no means remote, neighborhood on the island of Sodermalm. The intersection it is located at had little traffic. Two beaches are within a twenty-minute walk, and the more vivacious, hipster areas of Sodermalm are a short subway ride away.

A courtyard where you can chill and the kids can play. Our kids favourite were the bikes.
Great location, only a two minute walk to the underground station.
Quirky shops and cafes in the neighbourhood. Full of young families.

Carina waited for us with the keys and showed us around the apartment. It saved us time and frustration during our stay and we were quickly familiar with the apartment which was very well equiped (coffe machine, hairdryer). Carina left us with breakfast supplies. This really helped because we arrived in the afternoon and meant we didn't have to rush to the supermarkt to do the basic shop. Instead, we could spend  time with the family who live around the corner. Carina left drawing paper for our kids. Our kids made theirselves comfortable staightaway and started to play with Carina's kids' toys. One of her kid drew a nice welcome message and put it on her bedroom door.  

I loved the kitchen. Lots of space for the family to eat and cook together. The bathroom was newly fitted and very clean. In fact, the whole flat was very clean. 

We visited at easter time. We rolled our easter eggs just outside the building where there is a little hill. 

Overall, we had a great stay with no problems."

It has a wonderful feel and quietitude about it, and is ideal to come home to, after a tourist´s hard day about town.

We didn't met the family in person but everything was well organized. The apartment itself is a very pleasant, attractive and cozy place to stay for exploring the city and the surrounding of Stockholm. For two adults and two children it's ideal, especially to have two gardens in the direct neighborhood, one of them with a pool for younger childrens and a adjoining lawn. The metro is just 4 minutes to walk and it takes only 10-15 minutes to T-Centralen by metro. To sum up: it is a ideal place for exploring Stockholm and to join and relax the hours at home, sitting in the green yard eating fresh grilled meals and drinking some wine together."

We recommend this place and we hope we can stay there again if we come back to Stockholm !

Johan is very friendly and open to ask for recommendations. The precommunication was super. 
The bathroom is quite small but fine - and it's your private one. As a little notice, the bedroom has no door just a curtain which gives you privacy.
We had a great time and would recommend it to everyone.

We really enjoyed our stay here. Everything you need is there. Make sure to have dinner @ Harvest Home pub on Bondegatan, and visit the Fotografiska museum."

Ferat was a perfect host giving us great tips on how to get around and what to see and eat in Stockholm and there to meet us on arrival. The appartment is about 15 minutes bus from the center and walking distance to shops in the southern island. Would highly recommend his place and would welcome him to London anytime"

He welcomed us by very kindly picking my wife, and screaming daughter up from the train station which saved us a huge amount of stress and confusion. He then gave us a great tour of the local area to point out great places to hang out in Sodermalm, which we indeed did to - Pom and Flora was a particular favourite. Before leaving he made my coffee (much needed with a 6 month old baby!) and left us to it. The apartment itself is absolutely immaculate and really cool -  a great base for anyone visiting the area.  When it came to leave Ferat confirmed his legendary status by taking our bags from the flat (where he kindly kept them during the day so we didn't have to carry them) to the train station and met us there. A true credit to Air BNB and a great great apartment - he was very contactable throughout.

Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable."
"2743",2113398,33498423,2015-05-29,9950815,"Jordan","Ferat was an excellent host. He was easy to communicate with and actually was able to meet us at the apartment to make sure we acclimated smoothly. The apartment was very clean, tidy and modern. Everything you need to relax, refresh, feel clean and get ready to explore Stockholm. His sound system around the apartment is also a nice touch, easy listening in all the rooms. The area of Södermalm that the apartment is in is lovely. Walk anywhere or get on the 66 or 2 bus to get almost anywhere you need. Make sure you stop by Fröken fröjd for amazing pastries and coffee (say hi to JoAnna). We'll definitely be back to Södermalm and be staying at Ferat's place again!"
"2744",2113398,35648256,2015-06-21,29375457,"Carolyn","This was our first experience with AirBnB and Ferat made it wonderful! We felt at home from the moment we arrived which made our stay back in our home city of Stockholm so nice.  The apartment is exactly as it is pictured - neat, clean, great sound system, Netflix for a night in, and a comfortable bed!  Ferat is so helpful when it comes to your needs and we really appreciated how easy it was to work with him. 

The location is really good as it takes about 15-20 minutes to walk in to Gamla Stan, great restaurants are all around, and Coop grocery story is right around the corner. We've been eating in Södermalm for years but discovered so many new restaurants as the apartment location was new to us. Give Nook a try for a great dinner (though almost everywhere is really good), Urban Deli on the square is perfect for any meal, and Primo Ciao for pizza.  If the weather is good, take a walk up to the church and then down towards the square. You'll find a big hill where everyone picnics. Take a blanket, some wine, a baguette and cheese, and enjoy the sun. 

We are already planning our trip back and look forward to being in Ferat's place again!"

"2747",2113398,44016223,2015-08-23,8225119,"David","The apartment was comfortable and well-appointed, with lots of light and air. It is even nicer than the photographs. The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant in an interesting area, near historic old houses and the water. It is an easy 10-minute walk to the most popular shops and restaurants; there is a grocery store around the corner. We walked to Gamla Stan along the river several times; it takes about 35 minutes but the bus is also convenient and takes about 10 minutes. We spent a week in the apartment and really enjoyed living there. The roof-top terrace has a spectacular view and really adds something to the apartment. Ferat was a gracious and helpful host. He was responsive and considerate, even providing a SIM card for local telephone calls. We would recommend the apartment."

The apartment, fixtures and decorations look exactly as it does in the photos. It is spacious, light and homely. Everything in this apartment is spotless from the fully equipped kitchen to the modern bathroom and even details like towels are of top quality and clearly prepared for you.   

The area is also ideal, I was on a business trip and it was super simple to get into town, the neighbourhood is stunning with a great restaurant and bar scene just around the corner.

I need not mention that Ferat is the perfect host and makes an effort to get you settled comfortably, showing you how everything works and where to find it. 

Thanks Ferat, I had a great time in Stockholm and this was as good as I could have expected it to be. I hope to take advantage of your hospitality again in the future."

The apartment is well connected to transit and close to a cool area with a lot of good shops and restaurants. The place itself is as it looks in the photographs and is well equipped. We did find the building quite loud with outside leave blowers each morning and loud noises in the upstairs apartment, but overall it was a positive stay and we would recommend it. He even provided a SIM card for unlocked phones and accommodated us arriving a night early :)"

His apartment is incredibly well furnished and clean. I enjoyed using his fantastic Sonos sound system every morning over a cup of Swedish Coffee. When we ventured outside- we could not be better situated... Incredivly close to all Sodermalm has to offer and with a bus line right around the corner should we choose to venture to other parts of town."

Ferat picked us up at the cafe near his, though the check-in time is one hour later than we expected, but Ferat said he has to make sure everything's perfect when we get to the apartment, and it turned out to be very true. 

Everything you see in photos is exactly the same and when you step in the apartment, it would just be nicer than in photo with a delicate scent surrounds. 

The apartment is very well equipped and maintained. With its sono-system and appleTV, you could have a relaxing night just like home! And for us, the most amazing and important is that everything's, spotlessly clean!  I just love to keep that during our stay.

The location is great for us, you can easily find a bunch of great restaurants and cafes in this charming neighborhood. 

Ferat is fantastic, and we would like to see him again very much!"

Hun havde sørget for at der var morgenmad og kaffe, og var hele tiden sød til at besvare spørgsmål. Hun parkerede vores bil på deres landsted, så vi vi slap for at betale i dyre domme for at parkere i Stockholm centrum. Lejligheden kunne ikke ligge mere centralt, det var super lækkert, og lejligheden var så fin og smagfuldt indrettet. Min mand, forældre børn og jeg følte os så godt tilpas!! Vi kan på det varmeste anbefale Tinas skønne lejlighed!!  Tusind tak for et dejligt ophold!!"

Tina was a very gracious and helpful host and was present to welcome us upon our arrival. She was very accommodating given our trans-Atlantic flight arrived at 7:00 am and we needed an early check-in. She even had a pot of coffee and a light breakfast waiting for us. The pictures completely do the space justice, and there was more than enough room for three adult men. The apartment is clean, quiet, and extremely convenient to the sights of Stockholm. We easily walked to all of the popular destinations, and there are plenty of restaurants and bars in nearby Stureplan. Highly recommended!"

Everything we needed was there, Jessica was very kind, even left us a note that we could use her food from the cupboard.

Jessica's apartment is very well looked after, equiped with all you need in a kitchen if you want to cook. Hot water is always running without any need to press buttons, operate timers etc. So, it is quite relaxing staying there.

It was very easy communicating with Jessica before, during and after we have used her flat. She was always there, offering help.

Jessica has described that her flat can be reached from two metro stations. We used Telefonplan metro station for our commuting to the city centre because it was easy to find it; supermarket open until 11 PM was next to it.

The neighbourhood was not particulary vibrant, but it felt very peaceful and safe.

I recommend this apartment to families looking for accomodation in Stockholm, if they do not mind being  a bit out of the centre ( it is just short ride by very punctual and frequent metro train).

Jessica left us a lot of informations and kept in touch while we were there to check if everything was allright and gave us advices according to our trip...

The most difficult problem to resolve is which island you gonna choose to visit in the archipelago.

Lot of place to go with kids (like Skansen), highly recommanded.

Het (verwarmde) zwembad is, bij goed weer, ideaal om wat tijd in door te brengen.

"2786",2166026,26186753,2015-02-06,26191874,"Shocann","We traveled all together with 5 of us. Our landlord Janu’s house was ideal for our group. Everyone gets his/her own space and also shares the kitchen, the dining room and the living room. Very spacious and fully equipped, Janu even offered us a very detailed informative orientation letter to explain how to use the facilities around the house.
The transportation getting around is very convenient, 10-15 mins walking to the metro system, Stockholm city center is only 25-30 mins away from the metro. And 5 mins to the bus stop. So we didn’t have any trouble to get around.
Janu is warm and friendly, we had fun conversation during the time we stayed, and he lived right next to the house, so if you need support or simply have questions, you can reach him without any problem.
Overall, our stay was excellent, and we highly recommend it and possible we will want to stay at Janu’s house for our next trip to Stockholm."
"2787",2166026,27458926,2015-03-05,25382492,"Serge","Dès avant l'arrivée sur le site de la maison, l'hôte a été extrêmement accueillant par ses SMS, courriels et échanges téléphoniques pour nous donner tous les conseils et informations requises pour l'arrivée. Il nous attendait sur les lieux à l'heure convenue et nous a fait une visite complète du logement, avec tous les détails requis sur la localisation et l'usage de toutes les nombreuses commodités disponibles (ordinateur, imprimante, télévision, matériel audio, usage du tri sélectif, cuisinière, évier à broyeur, appareils frigorifiques, lave-vaisselle, machine à laver ...) ainsi que des produits courants pour assurer l'alimentation dès l'arrivée (de quoi dîner et préparer un petit déjeuner sans avoir à faire de courses). 
L'intérieur de la maison est extrêmement accueillant, avec de larges baies vitrées donnant sur un quartier résidentiel très calme, très accueillant avec ses jardins ouverts donnant sur le milieu naturel environnant (forêt peu dense de bouleaux et de pins)à, où les chevreuils viennent dormir à moins de dix mètres de la maison sans se soucier des humains, (même de ceux qui les observent non masqués par des rideaux) depuis les fenêtres  et où les écureils  s'égayent dans les branches pendant que l'on est à table. 
Les locaux sont d'une propreté requable, la literie est impeccable. Des chambres nombreuses ( au moins 4 à lit double + un grand local sous toiture avec large baie vitrée permettant d'héberger sans problème un couple avec 3 enfants) avec accès privatif permettent un  séjour d'une quinzaine de personnes au total garantissant à la fois la possibilité de se retrouver dans des espaces communs (une cuisine avec coin repas pour 6 à 8 personnes, une salle à manger avec une table pouvant accueillir de 10 à 12 convives, un vaste salon permettant de se retrouver sans être serrés  ...) et la possibilité de s'isoler dans des espaces privatifs (chambres) accessibles sans avoir à passer par les espaces communs. Deux terrasses de part et d'autre de la maison permettent de profiter du jardin côté accès, de la forêt du côté opposé. 
L'ambiance est très chaude, avec des points d'éclairage nombreux dont la plupart sont équipés de gradateurs permettant la modulation de l'ambiance lumineuse.
Le propriétaire (Janu) est un homme très courtois, polyglotte (anglais, allemand, suédois au moins), très accessible (sur les lieux, dans une dépendance à dix mètres de la mlaison qu'il loue), avec une vaste culture qui lui permet de s'adapter à des personnes d'origines très diverses, ce qui facilite largement le contact. Très confiant à l'égard de ses hôtes, l'accueil qu'il leur prodigue est extrêmement chaleureux. L'accès à Stockholm est très facile par la ligne 3 du métro à partir de la station svedmyra, à moins de dix minutes à pied . Une ligne de bus permet aussi si on le souhaite d'éviter quasi totalement la marche à pied. Bref, un séjour de rêve pour quiconque cherche à passer en famille ou avec des amis un séjour à proximité de Stockholm, loin du bruit et hors du temps. A recommander sans limites !!!"

La posizione è periferica, ma comodamente servita dai mezzi pubblici e con tempi decisamente bassi. Il contesto è molto bello, zona tranquilla è piena di verde, si possono fare meravigliose passeggiate nel bosco che    è collegato direttamente al giardino di casa.  Janu ha curato la sua casa in modo perfetto, non manca nulla e soprattutto è molto pulita. Gli accessori, come impianto stereo, computer, sauna, ecc. completano il tutto in maniera armoniosa. La casa è molto vivibile anche in presenza di tante persone, perché le soluzioni all'interno sono tante. Janu è stato molto disponibile ad ogni mia richiesta. Consiglio a tutti questa esperienza.

We were not disappointed!  We had room to spare and it is an easy walk to the subway which is a short ride into Stockholm.  Janu was an excellent host - he met us when we arrived and since he stays in a small house on the property, he is available and more than willing to help with suggestions and directions.  While we were there he was putting in a trampoline and allowed the children to use it which they enjoyed immensely and it helped burn off some of their energy. :-) The home is beautiful, has everything you need and is very private. It is spotless as well.  The neighborhood is safe, quiet and lovely.  We had a great 9 days/nights in Stockholm and highly recommend Janu's home."

Egal ob Grill, Sauna, oder spitzen Musikanlage in fast jedem Raum, es war alles da. Herzlichen Dank an Janu, der immer zur Stelle war wenn wir irgendwas gebraucht haben oder Tipps für Stockholm brauchten :-) Er war sehr flexibel bei unserer Anreise und hat uns zunächst eine Einführung in die Besonderheiten des Hauses gegeben.

Wij waren met een groep van 9 volwassenen. Het huis is volledig in retro stijl gemeubleerd, zeker ruim genoeg,  zeer goed uitgerust.
Gelegen in een rustige buurt is het een perfecte uitvalsbasis voor een Stockholm citytrip: het is ongeveer 1 km wandelen tot aan Stureby metro station en vandaar zijn er heel regelmatig treinen naar het centrum (10-15 min tot Centralstation). Valt heel goed mee."

Even better than the photos (I didn't think that was possible). The house was very clean, the sauna was a highlight and the rooms were very comfortable and all a good size.
The kitchen was well-stocked and the property was well-positioned and only 10 minutes from the station. 
The modern and quirky decor made this a really unique place to stay and frankly, it was hard to leave! I am already planning to revisit soon. Log fire, red wine and a perfect sanctuary in the woods - if you're after 100% relaxation - this is the place to find it."

Wij mochten in de ochtend een ontbijtje nemen van haar spullen, hetgeen niet inbegrepen was. In de omgang is Caroline uitermate vriendelijk en geïnteresseerd en de oude stad is op loopafstand.

Jakob had written a bit about the apartment and how things worked in a little book, which was very helpful. He also recommended a few restaurants, and we loved the ones we went to.

Ample buses and the Metro stop right outside the door help make life easy for the tourist. If you're going to Karolinska, its even better, as its a short bus ride away plus not to far from town as well. The room is very spacious and you wont get cabin fever with a nice view out the back. Downstairs there's plenty coffee shops, bars, and a trusty Lidl to pick up stuff. And it has 3 separate access to the building allowing you to get everywhere quickly. Liezl will help you with any questions you have, and was willing to come down and find me on a cold Feb evening."

Unfortunately, since Liezl and her 2 roomates were really busy working on the opening of their shop, they never took time to clean the bathroom after using it, even after I asked for that. That was upsetting I must say, to enter a dirty bathroom and bathtub, everyday.
The jacuzzi was also not working during my 2 weeks stay. So an overall ok opinion, excepted for the messy and dirty bathroom, which is not a complementary option where you are 6 girls in a flat."

The apartment is large and Deise's shares it with her two sons who are very polite and mature.  Our schedules rarely overlapped so we saw little of Deise's but she made us feel at home even providing a picnic basket wine glasses and chocolate when we mentioned we were going to go have a glass of wine. 
The bed is very comfortable and while there is a pub next door on the ground level the apartment was quiet other than some high school graduates having their traditional \"senior days\". 
Fabrique is a wonderful bakery that we visited often and shouldn't be missed.  There is so much to see in Stockholm that we spent little time in the apartment outside of sleeping but our time spent there was very comfortable."

Très prévenante elle nous a donné, avant notre arrivée, les bons renseignements (taxi moins cher que le train de l'aéroport), et nous a permis ainsi d'économiser de l'argent (du coup on a fait un petit restau de plus). 
L'appartement est absolument tel qu'il est décrit sur le site. La situation, idéale, en centre ville, permet de se déplacer très facilement. Il est grand, magnifique, agréable. Un vrai chez-soi. 
Nous avons particulièrement apprécié le marché couvert (Östermalms Saluhall) à côté. La boulangerie, juste en bas, n'est pas mal non plus. 
J'ai apprécié que Lova indique que la rue peut être bruyante parfois, je craignais un peu, parce que notre sommeil est léger. Mais d'une part aucune chambre ne donne sur la rue, c'est le grand calme (du moins en hiver) et d'autre part il n'y a que quelques rares passages de camions de livraison, qui ne sont en fait pas gênants.

We liked the general atmosphere of the apartment with all the plants and nice lightning. Neighborhood is very convenient, with a supermarket around the corner which is always open (even on new years eve and day ;) ), and a subway (T-Banen) nearby.

The apartment was relatively easy to find and we used the laundry facilities while we were there (and it's free!). The Sodermalm area is quite trendy and if you love to run, the waterfront is minutes away. There was also a SATS gym about 10m away that cost 150sek/day.  You can walk to Gamla Stan in about 40m or Sulahall in the same amount of time. The metro is minutes from the apartment as well and there's a grocery store just below. It seems most cafes aren't open until late morning so breakfast can be a little harder to find if you're an early bird.

The apartment is cute and is exactly what we wanted. A comfortable place to stay with all of the amenities we could possibly need. 

The location of the apartment was perfect. It was accessible via many different types of public transit but was also only a 10-15 minute walk from Gamla Stan (the old city) and a similar distance from SOFO. It was also closely surrounded by various restaurants, bars and grocery stores if you need anything or plan to travel on a budget and cook for yourself. I highly recommend this apartment."

The apartment in general is very comfortable and clean, and everything works perfectly: kitchen is perfectly equipped to cook whatever you want (oven, moka and American coffee machine, cooking plates, fridge, toaster, mixer!) and bathroom is nice. When we arrived we collected the apartment keys very easily from Yamandu. The apartment had a very good smell, everything was perfectly clean. The surroundings are quite nice: 3 supermarkets (opened until 11 p.m.) are located at 30 seconds walking distance from the apartment, you can see them from the window, and nice cafes and restaurants can be found in the area which is very lively also during the evening. The metro station is located at 1 minute walking distance from the apartment."

The apartment is perfectly located, on the north end of Sodermalm, so it has easy access to the lively bars in the neighborhood as well as to Gamla Stan for the touristy things (15 min walk). The apartment, and the bed, are small, but it's well furnished, secure, and clean. I would recommend it for a single person or a couple for sure."

Shops, good restaurants and cafes, the metro is a couple blocks away...I ended up walking everywhere anyway because Central Stockholm isn't that large if you don't mind walking. The apartment was large, comfortable, and clean- perfect as is described. I would highly recommend staying here if you're in the area. I definitely would stay here again. Amanda was a wonderful host and checked in with me several times to make sure I had everything I needed and was doing well. If I had any questions or problems she would reply almost instantly and help me out. She is also extremely knowledgable about the area so she recommended many great things to do and places to see/eat. Staying here made my entire trip worth it and much more memorable. Highly recommend."

Anna was terrific host, helping me identify the most convenient transportation from the airport and to my various destinations while in Stockholm and frequently checking with me to see if I needed anything. She even came to meet me for the short walk to her apartment."
"2969",2466500,24753831,2015-01-02,9106515,"Claudia","If I could write 1000 words, it would be easy to discuss in great detail how much I enjoyed my stay in Monica's apartment. However, since I am limited, I will focus on the highlights.

First of all, all of the earlier reviews are accurate. The location is terrific, especially if you want to stay in Södermalm, which is a very cool and interesting neighborhood, not at all touristy. The Skanstull T-bana station is about a two minute walk from the apartment and gives great access to the rest of the city. Numerous bus lines are also right there, and there are plenty of places in walking distance, such as great shops, grocery stores, and restaurants (and I highly recommend Pelikan and Kvarnen for traditional Swedish dishes, such as herring and meatballs, and I loved Urban Deli for its cool vibe, great gourmet specialties to buy, and a fun bar to eat and drink at).

My highest praise is for Monica and her beautifully and tastefully decorated apartment. It is so lovely that it could easily ruin you for future airbnb accommodations, which would struggle to measure up. This is also a grown-up apartment that has interesting and eclectic art, stylish and comfortable furniture, and a splendidly equipped kitchen. If you are a coffee drinker, you will especially appreciate the Nespresso machine and the fact that Monica generously leaves plenty of capsules.

Monica herself is a lovely, generous, and thoughtful host. She sets a very high standard that few in my experience could live up to. She is an outstanding communicator who always responded to my questions quickly and comprehensively, and I had a lot of questions because I was traveling with my mother, and I wanted to make sure all of her needs were met (for example, elevator in building, separate bed, great restaurants within about a 15 minute walk). She was also very flexible with our arrival and departure times, which were early on one end and later on the other (due to flight times). As others have mentioned, she left items for breakfast, but I'd like to emphasize that what she left was delicious and of very high quality (bread, cheese, ham, eggs, etc that were so good we ate them all and bought more of the same to take home [well, not the eggs!]). Since we were there for New Year's Eve, she even so kindly left us a bottle of Crémant! In fact, it seemed she anticipated all our needs.

I can only hope that Monica will continue to host guests, because my mom already wants to return next year for our annual mother-daughter winter trip to Europe, and I feel the same. I cannot imagine a better airbnb experience, and I cannot recommend Monica and her apartment more highly. Tack så mycket, Monica!"

El apartamento estaba limpio con todos los complementos necesarios funcionando correctamente. 
La habitación era mínima, sólo cabía la cama, no había espacio para mesitas ni armario, y para salir de la cama había que saltar por encima de tu compañera/o. Habían eliminado la puerta de la habitación. No había armario para dejar la ropa.
El apartamento es un primer piso con una parada de autobús delante en un calle con pendiente, por lo que los ruidos podían llegar a ser importantes, ya que el aislamiento no es demasiado bueno. 
El anfitrión no nos recibió a la llegada ni durante nuestra estancia pudimos conversar con el anfitrión o alguien relacionado con la vivienda, con lo cual no se cumple el principio básico de socialización que tanto predica AirBnB.

The location of the appartment was pretty convincing, everthing you need (restaurants, cafes, trainstation, supermarket) just a short walk away. Barbara was also a good host. Very welcoming, a friendly, cheerful person, giving advice to discover the city (if wanted;) we've been to Stockholm before, so we did our own kind of thing). Since she was quite busy and not too much at home, it felt like we had the whole appartment  to ourself, which was kind of nice, though I would have also enjoyed getting to know her a bit more, cause she seems to be a very cool person;) I would totally recommend this place and host!"

Ubicación: excepcional dentro de Södermalm, tiene todo lo necesario a pocos metros de distancia (Metro, comercios, supermercados, bares y restaurantes), se llega caminando a Gamla Stan (ciudad vieja) y a los principales lugares turísticos de Estocolmo.

El departamento en sí: más amplio de lo que se percibe en las fotos, cálidamente ambientado, silencioso, con ambientes de gran altura y luminosidad, cómodo por donde se lo mire. Nuestras hijas disfrutaban tanto jugando en el cuarto de niños que resultaba difícil salir a recorrer la ciudad.

Axel: si bien no estaba en la ciudad cuando llegamos se encargo de que su asistente nos recibiera a la hora convenida y nos diera todas las indicaciones necesarias para el uso del departamento. Durante la estadía nos llamó para ver si todo respondía a lo esperado. 

Sin duda volveremos a Estocolmo y esperamos poder volver a hospedarnos en este departamento.

Muchas gracias, Axel!

No shower curtain so the place gets a little wet. We did all the sightseeing by foot, which is very nice if you walk along the river, however there are plenty of public transport options nearby. Down the street plenty of restaurants and bars. Axel was very friendly, always a quick response and nice service. I would recommend this appartment to everyone. We had a great time!

The public transport (bus / commuter train / subway) works really well and is easy to use from the address - the app \"STHLM Traveling\" as we were informed by the host worked really well and allowed us easy to get from \"a\" to \"b\" . Would recommend 24 hours or up to 72-hour ticket, where you are free to drive puplic transportation in a large area (zone a, b, c, I think)."

It was 2 blocks away from the T-bana, Stockholm's wonderfully convenient and efficient metro system. There are also a good number of restaurants nearby, as well as two grocery stores by the metro stop. The building was very secure, and we enjoyed our stay.

We did experience confusion with check-in and check-out, though. We weren't able to contact Chris before we left for our trip, and we couldn't reach him when we arrived. His friends arrived a bit after we did though, so it ended up working out fine. The checkout process wasn't clear because we were originally told that our cleaning fee covered everything but later, we were asked to clean because other people were coming in after us. The confusion likely just stemmed from the fact that Chris was probably out of town, so his friends were helping him out. Beyond this though, our stay was pleasant and enjoyable."

The location is very good, close to the metro and lots of sights in walking distance. Chris is very nice, answers quickly, and was very flexible with my arrival and departure times. The only drawback is that the appartment lies just above the public terrace of the house and therefore it may be noisy at night, especially at the weekend.

De Wohnung liegt in Södermalm. Altstadt, Schloss, Slussen, SoFo, Hafen, alles ist zu Fuß erreichbar. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten Systembolaget, und tolle Restaurants (Empfehlenswert: Das Restaurant mit original schwedischen Gerichten, 40 Meter die Straße hoch) sind um die Ecke.
Marie empfing uns sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, es gab U-Bahn-Karten, Stadtpläne, Infos und Empfehlungen, sowie einen Begrüßungs-Sekt.
Die Wohnung ist sehr sehr gemütlich. Alles sieht zufällig zusammengewürfelt aus. Erst auf den zweiten Blick bemerkt man, dass hier ein Designer (der Mann von Marie) ganze Arbeit geleistet hat. Nichts ist zufällig, alles passt zusammen. Die Wohnung könnte ohne Probleme in der „Schöner Wohnen“ die Titelseite bekommen.

The location is very good - there is a bus station just in front of the building. It is a calm area but still close to everything you need (shops, restaurants, city centre).

They were easy to get hold of during our two week stay and were always very prompt at replying to all of our queries and messages. The instructions, recommendations and advice about local sites, restaurants etc. that they left for us on their kitchen table, before our arrival,  were spot on. This helped us get our bearings and make the most of our stay in Stockholm. Their house is in a beautiful residential neighbourhood with a real vintage feel to it. The house is a gorgeous place to stay at, enjoy the garden and relax.   All of the amenities are within walking distance and the nearest metro station is a quick and convenient way into the heart of Stockholm.  There are two nature reserves nearby with two lakes you can swim in and lots of places where you can go jogging and walking. If you plan to visit Stockholm as a family Sophie and Axel's home is ideal with all of its facilities at the highest standard. There is plenty of free parking in the road outside should you decide to rent a car. Sophie and Axel popped round once during our stay to collect their mail and say hello and they are extremely sociable and friendly.

The house is absolutely adorable and charming. We were impressed with how impeccably clean it was upon our arrival. The house is very comfortable and there is plenty of space to accommodate a family. Even though we didn't spend time in the yard, it is quite lovely too. The neighborhood is also very charming, extremely safe and conveniently located. It was super easy to get to central Stockholm from the house...a short walk to the subway (10 minutes?), then a 15 minute subway ride (the subway is very easy to navigate).

Cozy is the perfect way to describe it and the place felt like a home away from home. The flat is fully equipped with anything you'd need for the weekend and is well-located to grab public transportation to get around Stockholm. We never got to meet Frida in person as she was on holiday that weekend but her friend Jenny gave us a great orientation. It was clear though from our conversations that Frida is a lovely person!"

Her house is very near to the metro station and the suprmarket. 
It was very easy to be in touch with Frida. She always responds soon at you messages. She was there to welcome us and left us travelcards and a lot of nice tips!
We had a very nice week in Stockholm thanks to the tips and the cosy appartement."

Frida was very caring and gave us plenty of information for getting around in Stockholm. Frida, it was great, staying at your place!"

The place is just as described, really nice and clean and perfect for 2 people. A super luxurious couch and living room area that we loved, and the kitchen is fully equipped and ready for cooking. The neighborhood was another asset, centrally located and just north of a beautiful garden village while still being so close to the hip and fun Sodermalm. Would stay here again for sure! Highly recommend."

Se preocupó de la hora de llegada, nos condujo  hasta el apartamento y nos explicó con detalle planes que hacer en Estocolmo. El apartamento esta perfectamente equipado, es un espacio luminoso y tranquilo  para descansar. La decoración es preciosa, muy escandinava. Recomendable 100%. Frida se preocupo por nuestro bienestar hasta el último detalle, evitando que pasara calor o que tuviera un café a mi gusto. En 5 min a pie estas en el metro y a 10 minutos en el casco histórico. Cuando volvamos, que lo haremos, nos encantara volver a su apartamento. Gracias Frida!!!!!!!!!"

Lägenheten är otroligt fin, ljus och fräsch. Vi trivdes och kände oss verkligen som hemma. Tunnelbana och Supermarket finns rakt över gatan och det finns ett flertal restauranger i närheten. Vi kan verkligen rekommendera hennes lägenhet och vi hyr gärna den igen.

First the bus ride in from the airport was easy and hassle-free with the bus stop just a couple of blocks from the apartment.  Frida wasn't able to meet me but gave instructions for getting in and it was all quite easy.  The apartment itself was just as it appeared in the photos...only cozier!  It was well-equipped with everything you'd need, quiet, safe and within walking distance to shops/restaurants in Sodermalm.  Frida left maps and recommendations for places to see.  I was traveling with my small dog and the apartment worked well for him as there is a garden/grassy area in back.  Again, it was a great stay!"

It is only about 2 blocks from the metro and is in a very convenient part of town (Pizzeria, grocery store, liquor store, and much more all in walking distance).

Tämän jälkeen olin yhteydessä heihin kun tarvitsin viinipullonavaajaa, kun tv ei toiminut ja kun WiFi alkoi oikkuilla. Yhteydenpitomme oli asiallista ja vähäistä.

Huone ja kylpyhuone vastasivat täysin kuvausta. Ne olivat puhtaat ja siistit, liinavaatteet vaihdettiin pyydettäessä ja kaikki tarvittava pyykinpesuaineesta shampooseen oli tarjolla. Huone oli hiljainen, vain harvoin kuului majoittajan lasten ääniä, mutta ei häiritsevästi."

The room was cozy and comfortable. The bed is a bit small, but larger than twin size; my sister and I comfortably shared it. The personal mini fridge was a bonus!

The neighbourhood is a bit noisy, with busses going right by the window late into the night. There isn't much to do in the immediate neighbourhood, but it is a short walk to the T-bana (metro), not more than 8 minutes if walking slow. There is also a bus stop one house down the street, from which you can go toward the airport."

Monica replied back very quickly to let us know that the room was not big enough for two so she kindly booked us in the double bed! 

The double room is a perfect size, it had nice furniture that allowed us to work from our computers and go on with our day. Very clean and well decorated. She let us use the washing machine for 10 SEK and dried our clothes outside. 

Monica offered coffee and tea as well as biscuits to have in the morning. We also had some free time and told her that my friend and I want to go hiking around the neighborhood and she offered to let us her bikes! 

The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. The train station is only a few minute walk away and the bus stop is a short trip down the road. Very easy to get around wherever you need to go.

Staying in the Green Room was exactly what I needed; the bed was comfy, it was close to the bathroom and the mini fridge was a lifesaver. Everyone was very kind and helpful, very friendly and respectful of sleeping patterns! The room itself was great because I could open the door to the \"balcony\" and get fresh air and sunshine (my entire visit had perfect weather).

My friends and I really enjoyed our stay there and it was close to everything that we wanted to do and see in Stockholm.

The place is in a great location for seeing the rest of Stockholm as the tunnelbana is so close, the beautiful island Långholmen is so near, and the area Hornstull is lovely in itself. 
Ted and Carolina were very quick to communicate before the stay, and helpful, lovely people overall. The flat was clean, the kitchen well supplied and the shower never ran out of hot water with three people. The main bed was so comfy! [didn't try the camp beds but apparently they were perfectly fine too]. Supermarket very close by also.
The apartment is fairly small for three people, but fairly average for Sodermalm and for a short stay no issue. The flat itself is so nicely decorated, everywhere you look you see something different and lovely. Would definitetely stay again and would of course recommend."

   Lejligheden ligger virkelig dejligt. Der er kort til T-banen, hvortil to linjer kører = kort ventetid. Alligevel er der også kort til natur, og der er ret fredeligt i kvarteret. Indkøbsmuligheder er fine, og der er et par spisesteder lige ved."

Die Beschreibung im Internet entspricht damit den Gegebenheiten vor Ort. Die Wohnung ist in einer gemütlichen, ruhigen Gegend gelegen. Es gibt kurze Wege zum öffentlichen Personennahverkehr, womit die Unterkunft erstaunlich zentru (Hidden by Airbnb) ah liegt. Besonders toll war auch der Ausblick ins Grüne aus dem Schlafzimmer heraus. Wir haben uns außerordentlich wohl gefühlt.
Die Kommunikation mit Elin war sehr unkompliziert. Wir haben immer schnell Antworten auf unsere Fragen bekommen. Darüber hinaus war Elin so aufmerksam, uns auf eventuelle Umstände (die Wohnung war im 3. Stock, aber es gab einen Aufzug) hinzuweisen. Auch wenn sie leider nicht persönlich vor Ort sein konnte bei der Schlüsselübergabe, lief alles unkompliziert und wir wurden noch einmal mit einem umfassenden Informationsblatt empfangen.

There's even a kids room with some toys that our son played with - very carefully, of course. We had a car, and so it was a delight to always find a free slot close by - and parking is free of charge!

Our only regret was not meeting David -- my boyfriend and I had a super busy weekend in Stockholm with lots of family obligations, so we were in and out frequently and somehow missed David completely! We felt very comfortable, however, as he had been communicative as can be over Airbnb message prior to our check-in. Despite us and David coming in at different times, we never disturbed each other or were woken up or anything. He left detailed instructions for everything we could need, as well as his bike rental card, which we sadly didn't have time to use but was a really nice gesture. The room was spacious and comfy, with plenty of room for our luggage and a hair dryer which was great for me! He even left a snack for us for when we arrived, and a whole shelf for us in the fridge. The location is great, in a super safe and quiet neighborhood close to everything. We had to catch a 6 am flight at the end of our trip but easily scheduled a 520 SEK cab to the airport, 30 minutes away. All in all an A+ stay."

Of course, it does not come with the family, but for the price of a hotel room, you get three bedrooms a living room and a fully stocked kitchen.  One cupboard is reserved for guests but otherwise this is very much a lived-in house.  Sofo is a 10 or 15 minute walk away, and Skanstull tube station is a 10 minute walk from where the old town is a few minutes' trip.

She was very flexible with our travel schedule for arriving and departing. 
The apartment is a short walk from the station, and the building has an elevator. Everything is exactly as pictured in the listing, with plenty of room and tools for cooking, socializing and resting for two - any more or guests would be a squeeze.

The area was bright, vibrant, and safe-feeling. It was easy to get anywhere in town using SL, and walking to Gamla Stan is a cinch. 
Evelyn was a wonderful host and has put a lot of effort into making her place comfortable, if spare, for travelers."

The position was also perfect, you can find everything you need close by.
Only 1 min from the tunnelbana and 10 from Slussen"

"3247",2695984,28400733,2015-03-23,8573418,"Hannah","Evelyn was a great host, she came to meet us as soon as we arrived at Skanstull and lead us to the apartment. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for a short stay. Evelyn left us with information of the city and informed us of the easiest ways to get around etc. During our stay she also sent a message to double check everything was okay which was very reasuring and nice of her. She was a lovely host and would reccommend."
"3248",2695984,29036473,2015-04-03,18410303,"Dewi","My mother and I stayed four nights at Evelyn's studio apartment and found it spacious, airy, and comfortable. The living/sleeping area is open with a lot of room to move about; there is a nice-sized kitchen with a dining table for two, a nice TV, and a leather loveseat. The location is only 4 stops away from T-Centralen/Stockholm Central Station on the green line (lines 17, 18, and 19) and access to the T-bana from the apartment is only a 5-minute walk away, which makes it super convenient! You can also walk all the way to Gamla Stan via Gotagatan, the main street on the island of Sodermalm that is only around the corner from the apartment. There are also plenty of places to shop and eat nearby.

Though the apartment overall was comfortable, we did find it lacked a few things we think are necessary: a nightstand with a lamp by the bed would be advisable so that you don't have to get up and walk to the light-switch every time you want to sleep or use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Plus, it would double as a place to put our things, i.e. purse, cell phone, etc.  On this note, more storage space would have been appreciated. There is a closet with shelving and the bed has storage drawers, but both were taken up by Evelyn's clothes. We think Evelyn still lives in the apartment but it would have been nice had she left more storage space for her guests, or maybe put in an extra empty bureau against one of the bare walls where guests can put their clothes.

A full-length body mirror would be helpful, especially for women getting ready in the morning. The bathroom can use a trash can. We had to use one of the trash bags from the kitchen to make our own trash bin. A bathmat and maybe a new shower curtain would be better as the current one looks a little tired. Also, access to extra towels would be generous as only two were provided. We would also suggest paper towels and a microwave in the kitchen."
"3249",2695984,29730610,2015-04-12,26815697,"Trayton","Evelyn was great with communication when setting up details and met us right on time at Skanstull before leading us to her bright and airy apartment.

Situated four stops from T-Centralen (Lines 17-18-19), the place is very convenient for short hops into the city proper. Though a nice walk to Gamla Stan via Götgatan is very much worth it.
There are supermarkets very close by Skanstull (ICA Ringen & Hemköp) so you can pick up something on the way back from seeing the sights.

The lift was handy when it came to moving luggage and the place was very comfortable. Bed was perfect. Kitchen was clean and spacious and had near enough everything we needed to make some small meals.
One thing would have helped would have been the addition of a bed side table for our things. Though this is a very minor issue and did not at all hamper our enjoyment in staying at this apartment.

Evelyn sent a message to check that everything was okay which was very considerate.

Great value! If visiting Stockholm, I recommend it!"

Eva provided breakfast items and we felt comfortable cooking in the kitchen which we did for breakfast and several evening meals.  
They had a beautiful boxer named Hugo and he and their 2 cats accepted us as members of the family.

It is a little ways from downtown, but the metro is a short walk away and the ride doesn't take long.  My girlfriend and I didn't use the bikes they offered but I imagine it is a very easy ride to and from.  Great place to stay."
"3267",2709274,41643299,2015-08-08,38018647,"Lukas","My girlfriend and I spent two nights at Eva and Morgan’s for a short city trip to Stockholm, and we were extremely pleased with the hospitality they showed towards us. We arrived at noon and Eva kindly offered us to help ourselves to everything we could find in the fridge and the kitchen cabinets. She also gave us some useful tips as far as our itinerary was concerned, and on our second day, we seized the opportunity to explore Stockholm on Eva’s and Morgan’s bikes. In sunny weather you really shouldn’t miss out on this – it only takes you about 30 minutes to cycle into the city centre, and Stockholm’s cycle path network is extensive enough to prevent you from interfering with the motorised traffic too much. During our stay we had our own bathroom (towels were provided), and the bathroom as well as the rest of the flat struck us as being clean and cosy. All in all, Eva and Morgan really made us feel at home during those two nights. We can definitely recommend their flat as a place to stay in Stockholm. We would only discourage you from staying there if you do not like dogs (or if you are allergic to them, of course), and if you are very sensitive when it comes to cigarette smell. We detected a slight hint of this, which was not true for our bedroom and the bathroom, however."

They had a lovely number of things for breakfast (including homemade granola), were right next to the beautiful forest leading to Lake Mälaren, and were generous hosts. Eva went above and beyond to take care of us and we really appreciated that. Their dog Hugo is such a sweetheart and we loved getting to see him! Their place is a 10-15 minute walk to the t-bana (subway) which takes you into downtown Stockholm. The bed was a little small for two of us but they offered us another mattress if we wanted it. We had a good time chatting with both Eva and Morgen as well. They do both smoke (outside) so although our room didn't smell like it, it might bother some people in other areas of the house if you are sensitive to it. The room was nicely decorated and everything was very clean and cozy. They also had bikes for us to use but since we had the unlimited pass for the t-bana we didn't end up using them. Overall, a wonderful experience. If either of us need a place to stay in Stockholm again, we'll be contacting Eva and Morgen again!"

The apartment is in a lovely neighbourhood and being the walking type we were able to walk from the Arlanda train station as well as walk into the heart of the town. The apartment is just opposite a park so you can sit and enjoy the sunshine and watch the world go by. There's also lots of great restaurants around the area plus  a local supermarket for when we cooked at 'home' (the kitchen is excellently equipped by the way). The actual apartment itself was extremely clean and quiet and we loved the special personal touches that made staying there so special. In fact my nephew would have been quite happy to stay on permanently and Lena nearly had herself a lodger!"

In close walking distance, you can also find supermarkets and restaurants and only a few minutes away is a lake and a forrest, where you can relax, hike and watch several beautiful sunsets very good. I was in Stockholm during Midsommar and because I didn't know what to do, I asked Bijan, if we could celebrate it together and he said yes, so that we celebrated it together with his friends. It was a very nice day and a great experience for me.

Son appartement était calme et agréable ; Néanmoins, nous avons découvert en arrivant que le lit pour la troisième personne était un simple petit matelas posé par terre, et que toutes les portes avaient été retirées (sauf celle de la salle de bains-wc) : cela aurait dû être indiqué, comme le fait qu'il n'y a pas de volet aux fenêtres. Mais cela n'était pas gênant au final.
Le quartier est très agréable, sans dégradations visibles, et les suédois très avenants.

We flew in early but he let us drop off our luggage and hang out in the place while he was cleaning, and he gave us a bunch of great tips about what to eat/see/drink. It's in a great neighborhood, on a big street that every cab driver recognized, and a quick 10-15 min walk to the main sights on Gamlestan. Sodermalm is a hip neighborhood and there's lots of good food/bars/markets within a few minutes walk.

The apartment itself is nice too - bright and sunny during the day but also pretty good curtains for that ridiculous 3am sunrise, neat art on the walls if you don't mind some nudity, and a sweet sound system that worked with our iphones. The kitchen is also solid - we made coffee, cooked a steak, and baked cookies just fine.

Only warning - there's a washer but not a dryer, so you'll have to use the drying rack for your clothes. The two single beds look kinda small in the photos, and they're pretty low to the ground, but we fit two adult guys in them no problem."

The location made us feel more like a local than a tourist (just what we were looking for), but it was still within walking distance/a short subway to many of the \"must see\" spots of Stockholm. Louis was quick to respond with helpful tips and was very welcoming. We would stay here again without question."

Louis was an incredibly generous host and was there to greet us, answer any and all of our questions and he also provided  us with an incredible guide to the city with many of his and his family's favorite recommendations. 

This was an Air Bed and Breakfast 5 star experience and I would recommend his place to anyone visiting Stockholm."

"3381",2856241,29440486,2015-04-07,9645386,"Chris","We really enjoyed staying at Malin's family flat, it is extremely well located to the centre of the city and all its attractions - only minutes from the main train station for instance.  It is most comfortable and offers considerable space to relax and wind down after many hours on foot around the city.  Notable it is also very quiet and well screened from any urban noise.
It is also very well equipped with provisions such as kitchen items, cooking utensils etc. and benefits from a dishwasher.
It is also good to be able to experience staying amongst all the possessions and articles that the family own, and gave us a sense of a living and breathing apartment!  We liked the assortment of funky and unique furnishings, pictures and memorabilia around the home which made it feel like you were staying as trusted guests.
They were also kindly able to provide a further key during our stay.  I would recommend this apartment."

Malin et Sven se sont montrés très disponibles et arrangeants pour les horaires d'arrivée et de départ et ont été soucieux de notre bien être, tout en se faisant discrets lors de ces quelques jours.

The apartment is huge - yet cozy, and you feel at home straight away. We spend the most time in the great kitchen, cooking meals and hanging out before venturing into the city.

Also, there were some fresh strawberries, bread, and cheese waiting for us -- a very welcome addition as we were all hungry when arriving.  The location was convenient, not even a 1 minute walk to the grocery store and to the beach.  We were traveling by car, so we didn't get a chance to try the tram which takes you to the nearby subway stop.  The area is completely residential with plenty of walking/jogging trails along the water and some small playgrounds nearby for our kids.  An extra baby bed was also made available to us, which was a great help and saved us from having to travel with a pack-and-play.  Also, as my parents had an onward journey arrangements were made so we could use the laundry facilities in the building which was a huge help to them.  The only downside, mostly since we were at maximum capacity with myself, my wife, our 2 small children, and my parents, was that the storage/closet space was at a minimum.  This meant we had to live a bit out of our suitcases and off the floor instead of being able to hang up clothes and have sufficient shelf space to set things on."

In my experience, Britt-Inger is a lovely, caring and uncomplicated person - she was very flexible in allowing us to book her place very last minute and still managed to arrange every detail for the three of us to feel comfortable upon arrival. Entering her apartment
Felt just like coming home. Such a personal environment, beautifully furnished and decorated and the kitchen equipped with every utility you might need. The atmosphere is peaceful and calm. I felt so comfortable indeed that I didn't even want to leave when time came to travel on. 
It's just two minutes to a beautiful stretch of woods by the water, perfect for taking a walk, running, or meditating on a bench. 
It was very easy to get from the place to the Stockholmsmässan fair ground where we were working for the week of our stay. Public transport is nearby. Also a grocery store is right around the corner, which was very convenient.
I am grateful to Britt-Inger for being so welcoming and making our stay so lovely and easy. I very highly recommend her as a host. Thank you very much!!!"

Isabella was a perfect host, kept us informed of all details and even arranged for her boyfriend Alexander to pick us up at the airport which was a most welcome offer on a rainy Sunday evening!  The apartment was great, cosy and had everything we needed and more.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I come back to Stockholm.  The burgers at Flippin Burger are worth making another trip for!  A recommendation from Isabella that shouldn't be missed."

We are from the United States and have journeyed to Sweden on 5 occassions over the past decade.  We have stayed in hotels and apartments in Vasastan area and must relate that the accommodations at Isabellas were the best.

The apartment location and facilities were very appropriate for our needs and Isabella's concern for our comfort was demonstrated by how she prepared her apartment for our 10 day stay.

We heartily recommend consideration of her apartment of a couple.  We are in our 70s and everything was convenient for our needs.\"
I would also like to add that Isabel was very good at corresponding, making it easy to communicate and agree on details - it really creates a feeling of trust.

It is very clean and had everything we needed. Isabella was great about letting us drop our bags off a little earlier than checkin time. The only thing that was a bit of a issue was that we didn't have two sets of keys for the apt itself. We have extra keys for the building but not for the apt .  We like to go and do our own things but always had to be aware of being back in time to let each other in. Other than that it was good. When the pull out couch is pulled out for a second bed there really is no extra space but that was only at night so not a big issue. One of the great things is that the windows open to get some fresh air.

Derudover fik vi kort om nærområdet og kort over de nærmeste tunnel og bus forbindelser. Susanne bad os ringe hvis der var det mindste. Man blev efterladt trygt.

From Central Station to ARN Airport its about 1 hour via the regional train or the bus, and about 20 to 25 minutes on the Express Train.
The building is a 4 flight building with a small, narrow, clean, and well functioning elevator (lift). His apartment is on the 4th floor, and has view of the street facing buildings across the road. 
The apt gets a lot of light, and is very spacious and airy, and has a balcony.  I also got to use the kitchen and cook.  The apartment was very small, however this being  Scandinavia , and Sweden/Stockholm (as opposed to Lund, Malmo) the apartments are generally small.  However, I appreciate the well orgnanized and generally clean living space, and the high ceilings made the place breathable.

I stayed there for at least 6 days, and for personal reasons had to leave and could not complete by full 9 or 10 night stay.  Luckily, I also make sure before booking a place and try to book only Flexible Cancelation type places so it gives me more flexibility.  I will have to provide a personal note from my mother's doctor none the less to show my cancelation and get some money back, even when the policy for the apartment was of type Flexible.

I recommend anyone or a couple for a short or intermediate stay at Patrik's apartment."

But now to the flat.
It is a beautiful furnished, well designed and super cozy place with a nice view. beds and towels were prepared and we even got a a small typical scandinavian sweet. We walked all by foot, but next to the flat, there is the airport bus / the metro / lots of shops / Bars / restaurants.

Don´t forget the ice cream salon near to the flat ( I can´t remember the name of, you´ll find it on (Hidden by Airbnb) ). Probably the best ice cream i have ever had.

She met us at the apartment when we arrived and showed us around and showed us everything we needed to know. The kitchen was stocked with fruit and other food that she said we were welcome to. The apartment is perfect, so clean and well presented, lots of fresh towels and sheets. It's in a great location, only a few steps away from a metro so its a perfect base for exploring, I would love to stay here again and highly recommend it for anyone visiting beautiful Stockholm."

I especially liked the location, which is ten minutes from the local metro line (Skanstull stop-T bana), but it also easy to walk to most places of interest within about 20 minutes and is located close to the trendy SOFO area, which is full of quirky shops, bars and cafes.

Communicating with Miriam was easy and she supplied useful maps and guides. Unfortunately I did not get to meet her as she was away for the duration, so was greeted by her friend instead. 

Would recommend her home to any one, as it is the perfect location for an enjoyable stay."

"3475",2948828,39028300,2015-07-20,35302287,"Claire","Our family of four spent a perfect week in this lovely, bright apartment. Aspudden is just barely outside of the Stockholm city limits, on the handy red line which takes you quickly in to trendy Söder and directly to most places you will want to go (Gamla Stan, T-Centralen, etc). The neighborhood itself is also terrific -- calm and green with great parks, gorgeous waterfront for swimming and walks, a good bakery, supermarket, and cute cafes (Emma leaves you a good list and maps). We felt like we had the best of both worlds, quick access to the center of town and a real low key neighborhood experience.  We especially loved the bookstore-café, the newly renovated park playground and the very magical Vinervikens Trädgårdcafé that Emma recommended.  Emma's apartment is in one of the neighborhood's original renovated Art Nouveau buildings, with big windows, wood floors, and high ceilings. The apartment is stylish and artistic but low key enough to feel welcoming. The children's room is large and sunny, with books and toys. The kitchen is comfortable and stocked for cooking and eating real meals. Comfortable beds; nice living room; excellent laundry facilities in basement; fantastic collection of CD's and books for a quiet evening at home. Last but not least, Emma is simply terrific -- very welcoming and quick to answer any questions."

The area is highly recommendable (again perfect for children with playgrounds and petting zoo), the lake in walking distance (for those who like walking) and a cafe around the corner serves breakfast in the sun.   Emma was a very helpful and generous host, who made us feel welcome and comfortable in Aspudden. She even organized an extra bike for us."
"3477",2948828,42257951,2015-08-12,16800790,"Robert","We had a wonderful stay at Emma's apartment with our two young children. The flat is perfect for families, comfortable and very well equipped. Our kids loved the toys and the slide in the bedroom. It's such a nice area with a beautiful children's play park and lake swimming nearby - and an easy ride into Stockholm on the Tunnelbana for all the sights and museums. I'd recommend this place to anyone!"

Linda nous avait laissé des petites notes partout pour que nous trouvions les ustensiles et consignes diverses.
J'avoue que nous étions 4 et que durant le séjour nous avons quand même alterné entre le lit et le matelas gonflable dans le salon.
Bref, super séjour, je recommande cet appartement !"
"3479",2951723,37374476,2015-07-06,12295546,"Marc","I spent a long week-end with a friend in Linda’s apartment and it was perfect!
The apartment is nicely decorated, cosy, very bright and totally functional. The neighbourhood is quiet and calm. We particularly liked the balcony and the view we had on the roofs of the city. In fact, when we were in the apartment, we were spending our time on the balcony. It was really lovely.
The location is great – not far from the shore – as we were able to walk to almost every island of the city from there (during the day we never used the subway or a taxi). There are also some grocery shops, cafés and restaurant nearby. So everything is at walking distance.
The only negative point is the absence of shutters or curtains on the windows. We were in Stockholm beginning of July and the nights are particularly bright during that period of the year. 
But besides that, we don’t have anything to complain about and we would for sure rent this apartment again if we have the chance to come back to Stockholm.
Linda was a great host, very available and helpful before and during our stay. She made us comfortable and we almost had the feeling we were at a friend’s house.
To conclude: I truly recommend it!!

It's a very homely feel to the apartment with the decor and flowers and it's clearly a very well kept home.  Linda also left a good long list of nearby cafes/restaurants/bars including (helpfully) closing times of them!  You can walk any direction from the flat and find somewhere to eat, somewhere to drink or something to see and it's so easy getting to the centre.  Location, flat, host and views - all excellent.  Thanks!  One consideration is that, obviously being 4th/5th floor, you need to be able to do a good stair walk each time."

Ihre Wohnung ist ein Traum und perfekt für einen Aufenthalt von zwei Personen in Stockholm. Die Wohnung ist absolut ruhig und man hat einen wunderschönen Blick über andere Stadtteile Stockholms. Unmittelbar in der Umgebung finden sich alle öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel inklusive des Flughafenbusses, Supermärkte, Bars und Restaurants sowie kleine Antiquitäten-, Designerläden und Galerien. Lindas Wohnung selbst ist mit viel Liebe zum Detail ausgestattet und hat alles was man braucht inklusive einem schönen Balkon und einem Boxspringbett auf dem man wunderbar schläft. Einzig das Bad ist sehr klein, aber für einen kurzen Aufenthalt kein Problem.
Ich kann sowohl Linda als auch Lindas Wohnung zu 100% weiterempfehlen und würde jederzeit wieder dort wohnen."

It was perfect for the long weekend I had in Stockholm with my Mum. It's a lovely place to relax in after long days walking around Stockholm! 
Linda made us feel really welcome, and left us a list of restaurant recommendations (Folkbaren on Hornsgarten is definitely worth checking out!)
We really enjoyed our visit and would definitely recommend this apartment :)

Der var indkøbt et let måltid med ost og laks mm så vi lige kunne lande og pakke ud. Vores udlejer var meget hjælpsom med at finde rundt i byen via de lokale togforbindelse og hjalp med at downloade en rejseplan på mobilen. Den var til stor hjælp. Vi har nydt opholdet i et ekstremt hyggeligt og smagfuldt hjem hvor man virkelig føler sig velkommen. Huset har til fulde levet op til vores forventninger og mere til. Beliggenheden er tæt til tog og tæt til centrum. Haven er som at sidde i et sydfransk hus med udekøkken og grill og svimmingpool og sauna og udendørs bad. Vi kan på det varmeste anbefale et ophold her. Vi håber at vi kan vende tilbage til samme sted i nær fremtid.  Kh Tim & Trine + 4 børn."

We were two adults and two teenage girls, and the apartment was perfect for us. It has all you need, the atmosphere is familiar, and it is situated close to some really nice parks and to the metro system (which means close to everything within a few minutes ride).

Annika and her husband Robin are very friendly and helpful. Communication is easy, we got quick responses to all questions, and Annika provided us with 'Stockholm-insider-tips' about restaurants, bakeries and tourist activities. 

It was Annika's husband Robin, who met us when we arrived. He introduced us to the apartment, helped us park the car (500 SEK for a full week), showed us the nearest supermarkets and lent us the keys to his and Annika's bicycles.

It is obvious, that Annika and Robin wanted us to feel welcome both in their home and in Stockholm, and we can highly recommend this apartment to others."

We got the key from his dad which worked perfectly. We got to Peder's place from the airport by bus (s:t Eriksplan) which is a 5 minutes walk. Also, there's a subway stations 3 minutes away from the apartment, which goes directly to the city center.

The apartment is very nice, clean and cozy. Also, the whole house was very nice and we never heard anybody else, so it's very quite.

There's all the necessary stuff in the kitchen to have cook a nice meal. There's a big TV with an apple TV connected so we could stream some music using airplay, which was nice as there are some nice integrated speakers in the room.

We had a wonderful time. And would definitly use Peder's place again. Peder had the instant-booking feature activated which we used when booking the apartment. He later charged a couple of Euros more than the original price from the instant-booking option. The price was still fair, but that was the only negative thing I could think of. :P"

Before my business trip, she made sure I receive detailed instructions, including the screenshots with public transport schedule. She was flexible to arrange the handover of keys for my very late arrival. Upon arrival, I found a note to make use of sandwiches and soft drinks in the fridge – what a great reception indeed! The cozy apartment is in great Sodermalm neighborhood, convenient for fellow runners as the apartment faces a nice Roselundsparken, so I used the opportunity for jogging. 
Short walk to the Tunnelbana/Metro, but if you are lazy enough, there is also a bus stop in front of the apartment block that takes you to Skanstull Metro station in 3 minutes.  
I certainly would consider staying there again when I visit Stockholm. Speedy wifi, tea/coffee available, fully equipped kitchen to cook a meal, the iron with the iron board, and last but not least – an umbrella that I forgot to pack from home, for a rainy morning in Stockholm.
Great value for the money!"

The place was as nice as advertised, super clean and all set up with a mattress on the living room floor for the kids (three and six) and a nice bottle of red for us. Our cooking was mostly limited to coffee, tea and toast but the kitchen provides all the high end equipment you will ever need. The location is hands down the nicest in Stockholm if you like good food, bars, music, parks and water. And if you can't find what you need here, it's right on the tube. We'll definitely be back soon."

The only very minor thing was that the bathroom door didn't seem to close properly while we were there. But apart from that, everything was clean and perfectly in place.

There was plenty of floor space to spread out our suitcases, as well as a bit of handy hanging space by the door. It's in a great location in Södermalm near lots of cafes and shops. Johanna was very responsive to our emails before and during our stay. She was very accommodating of our arrival and departure times, making sure it was very straightforward to get the key, and to be able to leave the flat on the final day at a time that suited us.

The bed is not a full-sized double (a small double I guess) and the bath is little, neither of which were at all problematic for us, but we thought worth mentioning in case you're two really tall people who struggle sharing beds!

Her apartment is super cute, trendy & clean and located in one of the best areas in Stockholm. The photos are 100% accurate and it's an ideal place for a couple, although a 3rd person could easily fit in the couch. In terms of equipment I cannot think anything missing and it even have a dish washer if you felt totally lazy. 

The neighborhood has numerous options in walking distance for drinking, dining & shopping  and Malin left us a comprehensive list with her personal favorites that really helped. When back in Stockholm, staying again at Malin's is no brainer and will totally recommend it to anyone visiting the city."

Location, of course (you need to be a Stockholm/Sweden \"insider\" to understand how priviledged it is to spend time on this special island just outside the city centre). The house is a darling, just what you need for some days of relaxation. And a running tour around the island in the mornings... Absolutely wonderful. David made us feel very welcome - a huge thank you to you and your family! Actually, I would prefer to keep this place as a secret - just for us :-)"

It’s idyllic location in a most wonderful park, but only about 15 minutes bicycle ride from the city of Stockholm couldn’t be better if you’re looking to relax in a country side environment together with city sightseeing.
The only minor caveat is that the house hosts two parties and sometimes you hear the neighbor walking upstairs. Nothing really disturbing, but one should be aware that you’re not all alone in that house.
We did not have the chance to get to know our host in person, but only talked once in the beginning when we had some questions, which were promptly and kindly answered."

Can't complain about the room: Double bedroom, old authentic chimney (which works) and a very nice bathroom which has heated floor. Location is also pretty convenient in Sodermalm.

We will come back and we will go for the same option again."

Tara is really helpful, friendly and easy to communicate with, she gave us some good recommendations upfront. The apartment is nice as you really have your own space, it is clean and it has a modern shower/bathroom. Although the ventilation in the bathroom is making a lot of noises (as well as the toilet, which keeps on flushing) which woke us up at night several times in a row. Furthermore, there was one curtain missing, which enforced us to use my scarf as a curtain... Overall, good value for money."

"3599",3041009,27395384,2015-03-03,26284917,"Tim","Our first visit to Stockholm was a very pleasurable one - beginning with the clean, warm space that we had reserved with Tara.  The location was more than ideal with the flat being about a one minute walk from the local metro, which allowed us to quickly explore all that Stockholm had to offer.  The vicinity of the restaurants and cafes around the Sodermalm neighborhood was a welcome addition.  We found the flat to be exactly what we were looking for.  Tara made herself available leading up to our stay in Stockholm every step of the way despite being a new mom with many other responsibilities to take care of - thank you for being a gracious host Tara!!

It is a sweet little studio in an excellent central location with a lot going on and places to hang out. The flat is right across the street from an amazing view of Stockholm - Monteliusvägen- off the street Torkel  knutsson so one should grab a coffee and walk over sometime! It was also quiet with a very comfortable bed, clean, and characterful. We were exploring Stockholm for a long weekend and found it perfect to come back to after long days out. Nice to have curl up with the teas and biscuits in the room. It is comparable to staying in a hotel room for quality and service so I'd definitely recommend it. Tara is wonderful and warm, and the little interactions with her and her husband added something nice to the stay. I will probably look her up on returns to Stockholm!"

The location is great - walking distance to all the restaurants and vintage shops of Sodermalm, but also only a couple of metro stops away from the Central station and Old Town. We found the apartment to be just what we needed, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom well equipped with a great shower and we wouldn't have changed anything about our stay. We crossed paths with Tara a couple of times because she lives in the apartment across the landing, and she was helpful and friendly. During our stay she sent me a message to let me know about the royal wedding taking place, which was very considerate of her. If in Stockholm again one day, I would gladly stay at Tara's again.

We were in a great location to walk all over Stockholm and it was nice to come home at the end of the day to a couch to read in. We enjoyed using the little tea pot and Tara left us tea cookies. It was also very handy to have the little  refrigerator. We kept breakfast food in the frig and didn't have to go finding a place to eat at before venturing out each day. We loved the grocery store selection nearby and found one with a really healthy salad bar; great for eating less costly dinners and if you need a break from bread and cheese. Tara and her husband made it really easy to find the key to get settled and were available easily if we needed anything. Thanks so much Tara!"

Beskrivningen av rummet stämde precis men inte rubriken \"Charming apartment...\"; det är ett rum man hyr, inte en lägenhet. Snyggt och prydligt badrum. Det fanns en vattenkokare men ingen kaffekokare och heller inte TV. Allt detta framgår av beskrivningen och vi får skylla oss själva att vi inte läste den... Det var i alla fall tyst och lugnt. Men sängen! Väldigt mjuk (nerlegad?) vilket kändes i ryggen på morgnarna. Men detta rum vill vi inte hyra igen, det kändes för trångt. Fint att kunna fixa egen frukost.

In der Umgebung befinden sich viele Restaurants und an der Haltestelle Hornstull haben wir in einem großen Supermarkt einkaufen können. Auch die Busse halten in der Nähe.

I thought I could use Maria's dongle for wifi as stated on the host page but that was not so. This caused lots of problems for me, plus the area has very little mobile data reception so it was a problem for me. I was also was in need of a washing machine but there was not one in the flat and there were no near by laundry facilities according to my host so I ended up washing everything in the kitchen sink!!!! The kitchen didn't have a kettle so making tea meant boiling water in a pan plus there were no frying pans which was problematic with some of the food I wanted to make. The TV also had only a handful of basic channels as the freeview was not connected up. 
I would not recommend this flat if you are staying for more than a couple of nights maximum as you will begin to miss all the basics. I think Maria should definitely install wifi and fix the TV."

The location was fantastic – away from tourists, but close to great cafes and bakeries and within walking distance to lots of interesting shops and restaurants in Södermalm. We also found the walk to Gamla Stan very easy. There's a metro stop very close by if you're heading further afield.

The apartment was huge, warm and full of personality – a lovely place to come home to after a day of sightseeing. The wifi was fast, and the bed was big and very, very comfortable.

Per was friendly and gave us some great local tips and even left us  breakfast supplies and fruit which was most appreciated. I would definitely recommend staying here on your next trip to Stockholm."

There is a very nice park around the corner with jazz music on a summer weekend as well as good restaurants. The apartment has a very unique decorative style, we especially liked the leather armchairs. The place is quite large and airy, the living room is not actually pictured in any of the photos, it was plenty of space for a couple. The bedroom with a large bed and black out shades (great for the light summer nights!) faces a back courtyard and is very quiet. We did not meet Per in person but had a great experience communicating by email and appreciated the fruit and breakfast items which were left for us. We would highly recommend staying at Per's place"

It is the best location in Stockholm, after 8 nights exploring the city I can say that with great confidence. The apartment itself is a very spacious, well designed space, with a huge bed and very large windows that let tons of light throughout. I was looking for a patio during my search, no need for patio when large windows open to the street and provide a nice perch. Mariatorget park is around the corner with great shops, cafes, and bars/restaurants. The best part is the location,  the quiet place so close to all the action. Recommend Nytorget 6 as a great dinner/drinks night as well as place called Bleck for an amazing hidden outdoor dining experience . Stop searching and book this place."

Kitchen is well stocked with all the tools you need to make meals, which we did regularly. Beautiful location (really nice views from bedroom window), surrounded by green and a lake close by.  As a host Bjorn was very welcoming (made us a swedish meatball dinner!), helpful with suggestions and recommendations and while being friendly and interactive was also willing to give privacy and space.

Tout l'appartement était très sale, pas aspirer, le sol pas lavé.
Les WC et la salle de bains dégoutant, pleins de cheveux et de poils!!!!
Les plans de travail de la cuisine étaient tout gras, ainsi que la cuisinière.
Nous avons du patienter 3H pour que Carina vienne constater les faits....
Entre temps elle nous a envoyé une femme de ménage qui devant nous s'est mise à faire n'importe quoi: nettoyer les sanitaires en 5mn sans rien rincer, laissant plein de détergent sur les plans de travail et le lavabo.
Ne songeant même pas à nettoyer la cuisinière.
Après avoir aspiré le couloir et la cuisine, elle a jugé que tout l'appartement été propre !!!
J'ai du me fâcher pour quelle daigne aspirer et nettoyer le sol d'une des 2 chambres !
Ensuite elle est partie, estimant peut-être avoir fait son travail !
Losrque Carina est arrivé, elle a pu constater par elle même
la négligeance de la femme de ménage.
Elle nous a demandé de partir 40 mn afin de tout nettoyer.
A notre retour, c'était mieux mais quand même pas au top: on ne nettoie pas très bien un appartement de plus de 60 m2
en 40 mn !
Nous avons donc du attendre presque 4H pour pouvoir nous installer dans un appartement à peu près propre !
Carina s'est excusé avec une bouteille de champagne; j'ai acceptée de rester car en plus elle ne connaissait pas la procédure si nous voulions un remboursement !
Sinon l'appartement est très bien décoré et agencé ( sauf la salle de bains minuscule ), la vue est magnifique et le quartier super agréable.

Right down the street from the Slussen train stop. Very easy to get to / from. Great viewpoints of Stockholm are only a short walk away.  We stayed for an extended period and would definitely consider staying there again.

The location is fairly high up and requires walking up hill(s) or stairs to get to.  The master bedroom faces a private courtyard and is pretty quiet. Sometimes you'll hear street noise from the other rooms but it's generally not too loud. The upper bunk bed in the second bedroom is pretty high up and likely difficult for most adults to climb / sleep in.

"3741",3143879,30029793,2015-04-16,3131789,"Syahirah","Honestly just decent. It wasn't the best stay I've had in Airbnb. Firstly when I was first checking in, Karin didn't even get fetch me from the entrance, expected me to get in the building by myself. Didn't tell me it was on the 5th floor, I didn't know there was a lift, so I dragged my luggage up (which was exhausting). Secondly, the kitchen & toilet wasn't clean at all, it was pretty dirty to my standards. Crumbs on the floor, insects in the toilet. Hmm I couldn't see myself spending so much time in either rooms. Thirdly, there's just too many rules. I was in Stockholm for a vacation, not a \"camp\". Lastly, I was pretty much annoyed at the fact that the wifi has a bloody time limit (do note: even though it's called free wifi she'll turn it off when she sleeps so you can't do anything at all) Oh not to forget I was in for a rude shock after my shower one day and I saw a dog in the kitchen. Due to my religious beliefs, I can't let the dog touch/lick/come near me. It's not about me touching the dog, apparently Karin doesn't understand and  she didn't inform me earlier. I felt stressed staying here so I'm glad I'm out. To those thinking about staying here despite the perfect location & decent price, think again!"

She recommended local places, shared her home made recipes when she discovered we have a love of the same kind of foods and we even shared yoga moves and business tips (since I have my own business too). Her building is in the centre of everything you need in Sodermalm (including bars if that's your thing) and the cafe culture and shopping is fabulous. Karin's is perfect if you want a warm welcome, space to do your thing, love that Karin wants space to do her thing during the day, and appreciate good food. Her wifi is excellent and the view from the room is over a park which is lovely. Tack, Karin.

Each morning we had a lovely selection of breads, homemade jams, fruit, some cheese and nuts. She was extremely accommodating and adaptable to our particular needs and requirements.

Not only did we feel at home but I loved the coziness  and functional design of her apartment. The location was perfect as we were in the hip neighbourhood of Sodermalm better known as SoFo by locals.

Karin shared so much historical information about Stockholm and we had the most stimulating chats. 

She was the perfect host for anyone who has artistic and intellectual views.

Although she indicated she may change this in the future if you are a single traveler, the bed is fine but if you are a couple she's more than willing to add the extra bed and mattress.

We were sad to say goodbye and look forward to staying with her again.

Karin provides, a piece of fruit, several slices of good bread and various nut butters and jams. She was a friendly hostess to us."

La chambre est conforme à la description, assez petite (pas de placard pour ranger les affaires) mais calme et lumineuse avec vue sur un parc.Beaucoup de règles à respecter (y compris enlever ses chaussures, baisser la lunette des toilettes ...), ceci donne une impression de malaise.

Vi var överens om att jag ordnade min egen frukost, så den kan jag inte lämna något omdöme om. Boendet fungerade mycket bra, Karin tog emot mig på utsatt tid och visade mig rummet och faciliteterna. Rummet motsvarar bilderna. Karin var vänlig mot mig, och vi respekterade varandras privatliv. Området är livligt och det finns många restauranger och trendiga butiker att besöka."

She is a very engaging person and a delight to talk to--we had several great conversations while I was there.  The room itself was great--a nice breakfast spot (and Karin provided breakfast too!), chair by the bed, and plenty of space.  The location of the apartment is great--easy walking distance to everywhere and close to a metro for easy access for travel to and from the city.  Her neighborhood was just great too.

About the area: There's a nice waterfront to have a nice stroll, when the weather is lovely. Hornstull area is full of bars, thus on weekends there are parties going in till the early hours. The loud music does not reach Sirkka's flat. Only the noise of some screaming people on the street."

Luckily there was e second bed in the room because the one we saw on the picture in Airbnb was a bit smaller than expected. I guess it was not more than 120 cm, but with the second one it was no problem. Unfortunately we did meet Sirkka personally.

Also all amenities were near by, subway was great to get around city.
I had difficulty logging into the WiFi,  and Sirkka had told me to call her but I had difficulty with my phone and couldn't do that. I should have done it while she was still there but I wasn't thinking straight.

It's very convenient to go to the airport or go to the central station and other tourist sights in the city. Sirkka is a very nice host.

The apartment is as lovely as it looks in the photos and everything was clean and tidy when we arrived. The decor in the flat is beautiful, with a small balcony for the sunny weather and a fab kitchen and bathroom! Aleksandra was very helpful in giving us instructions to find the key etc and how to get to the apartment! Aleksandra's place is perfectly located and is a 5 minute walk from the Grondal tram stop- to get to the city centre we took the tram from Grondal to Liljeholmen and then the metro from Liljeholmen to anywhere in the city (journey from the flat to the central station takes only about 15 mins)! The area around Grondal/Liljeholmen is beautiful- with a large lake/swimming area which is perfect for a morning walk! 
We had a fabulous trip and would like to thank Aleksandra for all her hospitality- great host, great apartment and a great location!"
"3820",3188759,37830318,2015-07-11,22084312,"Isabelle","Stockholm is a magnificent and welcoming city.
The apartment of Aleksandra is very nice, but there is just no space for your luggages and all the stuff you carry with you for holidays. So the lovely ambiance was a bit disturbed by our bags (nearly) in the middle of the room. Unfortunately we didn't use the lovely terrace because it was pretty noisy with a view on a huge highway bridge (very close). The dish washer and the washing machine were out of work which was a bit annoying, because only two towels in the bathroom, this was very tight for a one week stay and two people.
Nevertheless, the apartment is located in a pleasant area very close (10 minutes by feet) from a very beautiful park ( Vintervikens Trägard). It is also very easy to connect to city center from Liljeholmen station where there is also a direct connection by bus to Arlanda airport. We discovered it on our own, Aleksandra just indicated  by SMS where to take the keys and where to leave them, (reminding the precise time to quit)."

Ihre Wohnung ist, so wie man es auf den Bildern auch sieht, sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Ihre Bilder in airbnb entsprechen dem aktuellen Zustand der Wohnung. Die Wohnung liegt relativ verkehrsgünstig (mit Bus und U-Bahn in max 15 Min. am T-Centralen,in max 10 Min am GamlaStan). Ihre Wohnung liegt auch in der unmittelbaren Nähe eines Sees,um den man hervorragend drumherum joggen oder in den man auch baden gehen kann.
Die Wohung hat einen tollen Balkon, leider befanden sich auf diesem nur zwei Stühle und ein Plastiksessel. Toll hätte ich einen Tisch gefunden, denn das Wetter war durchaus so gut, dass man hätte draußen Essen oder sich aufhalten können. Die Wohnung ist für zwei Personen super, großzügig im Schnitt,mit großem Bad, einzig der Schlafbereich auf der Empore ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, da man auf dieser nicht aufrecht stehen kann, sondern sich gebückt oder kriechend vorwärts bewegen muss. Auch staut sich dort oben an warmen Tagen die  warme Luft. Alles in allem haben wir uns in Aleksandras Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt und die doch relativ verkehrsgünstige Lage (mit dem Flughafenzubringerbus direkt bis zur Station Liljeholmen, das war super!) war angenehm.
Ich würde die Wohnung wieder buchen. Danke an Aleksandra."

Beliggenheten var perfekt for oss, og det passet oss perekt å bo i en romslig leilighet, i stedet for på et hotell. Leiligheten var sentral (vi brukte under ti minutter på å gå inn til sentrum), men lå i et veldig rolig og hyggelig område. 
Vi traff aldri Anna og Björn, men de hadde lagt igjen nøkkelen hos en café rett rundt hjørnet, og svarte raskt på alle våre henvendelser. I tillegg hadde de lagt igjen et skriv til oss med den informasjonen vi trengte, samt gode tips om nærområdet. Vi vil helt klart vurdere denne leiligheten igjen neste gang vi besøker Stockholm!"

Det är en otroligt fin lägenhet inredd i en ren Stockholm-klassisk stil. Vi uppskattade att sitta vid långbordet i köket och njuta av långfrukost. Bröd köpte vi på ett genuin-franskt café precis runt hörnet.  
 
Lägenheten var ren, fräsch och med ett välutrustat kök för den matlagningsintresserade :) 
 
Lägenheten ligger nära den fina strandpromenaden - Norrmälarstrand. Lokationen är perfekt, med tjugo minuterspromenad in till Stockholms central eller annars nära till såväl buss som t-bana.

The kitchen is very well equipped and there is loads of space in the fridge and freezer for your food. The bedrooms and bathrooms are well sized, clean and simple.

The apartment was roomier than it seemed on the site, there were actually one double bedroom and two single ones. It was well equipped, comfortable and quiet to live in. Two points to mention thought; first, Sara like many Swedes, apparently loves the light and has almost no curtains. It was cloudy most of the month but could have been very hot in the living room if the summer had been sunnier. In the main bed room, the curtain doesn't cover the whole window and it got light at 3 am!
Another small issue was the shower, built into a cabinet and truly tiny, we did get used to it but it doesn't suit everyone, especially if you are large sized or claustrophobic. We liked the kitchen a lot, it was quite
 new and well equipped, the balcony was cute and we loved being surrounded by Sara's many books.
All in all we had a lovely experience and would gladly go back in the future."

For us this was the most important. Rooms are clean, basic kitchen is there, wi-fi is on. As a plus there are 140cm bed, Apple TV and quiet neighborhood."
"3892",3216031,33370984,2015-05-27,17969068,"Eva","I stayed in Alex's apartment for 10 days and would gladly stay there again.  It is a great location, an old beautiful building with large windows and with updated bathroom and well maintained.  A large TV was a bonus even if I didn't have much time to watch! 
I had problems locking the front door the first day, but Alex came over and showed me how to do it.  You need a strong hand and a written hint on this will save Alex from having to come back to instruct.  I had some problems with Internet and it might have been due to construction on the courtyard side of the building.  Otherwise I was not affected by that construction.
Thanks Alex."

The apartment was as per the pictures. The big plus of the place is the central yet quiet location. If you need calm, I recommend it.
The TV remote was missing, which was a minor annoyance. However a new one was provided after a few days."

We had fresh sheets and towels upon arrival and the apartment was clean.

Communication was easy and all our questions were answered politely, even though we never had the chance to meet Alexander in person ;) 

We can recommend staying at this apartment to anybody wo wants to be in a nice and calm part of the city. Everything can be reached by foot (places like Djurgården or Strandvägen for example).

Leiligheten fremsto som i omtalen og passet vår familie (to voksne og tre barn i alderen 5-8 år) perfekt. Området var stille og barnevennlig. Leiligheten var godt utstyrt (vi manglet ingenting) og den korte avstanden til t-banen gjorde det lett å ta seg frem og tilbake til sentrum."

C'est un appartement moderne, confortable, facilement accessible via le métro (tunnelbana); situé à environ une douzaine de minutes du centre-ville, cela en fait une localisation idéale.  L'appartement accueille facilement une famille de 5 personnes et offre toutes les commodités de la vie moderne (laveuse, sécheuse, lave-vaisselle, télé, wi-fi, airplay, etc.).  L'appartement est très propre et calme. Le quartier est tranquille avec des épiceries à proximité.

À notre arrivée, comble du bonheur, il y avait même une bière dans le frigo!  J'ai particulièrement apprécié mes fins de soirée, avec la musique qui jouait doucement dans l'appartement, via le réseau airplay.  

Même si nos hôtes étaient absents à notre arrivée, ils nous avaient transmis les indications essentielles pour récupérer la clé (merci à David de nous avoir attendu).  Quant au 'fonctionnement' de l'appartement et des alentours, Lasse & Sanna ont préparé un cahier des plus complet qui contient toutes les informations utiles pour bien vivre dans leur appartement et dans le quartier (emplacement des épiceries, terrains de jeu, restos, piscines, etc.).  Des cartes sont placées dans ce cartables pour permettre aux voyageurs de se retrouver dans le quartier et dans la ville.

Bref, rien n'y manque et on se sent chez Lasse & Sanna comme à la maison.  Vraiment, nous recommandons vivement à tous les voyageurs de s'arrêter et de loger chez eux.

Merci!

Lejligheden har fungeret perfekt som base for udforskning og oplevelse af den skønne hovedstad i Sverige. ALT er bare i orden i den lille lejlighed - og placering tæt på T-bane perfekt. Wifi er et must med teenagere - og det fungerede upåklageligt. Vi nåede ikke at se så meget i nærområdet - men vi forelskede os totalt i Stockholm. Vi kommer MEGET gerne igen - og kan kun anbefale denne lejlighed til par og familier der vil bo roligt og godt 10 minutter fra centrum!"

My five-year-old son just felt like home in Sally & John's children's room. Although we didn't meet our hosts personally the conversations was super from the beginning. They did everything to make us feel good and we found a welcoming place for our stay. The surrounding was just top: The Vasaparken with its huge playground is just across the street, there are many inviting restaurant, cafes, shops and supermarkets as well as a fantastic toy store nearby. Metro is just a short walking distance away as well as the famous restaurant Tranan which is a must! All in all two thumbs up for this charming accommodation! Absolutely recommendable!"

From the first moment the kids and us felt in love with the flat: great spaces, big dimension, very practical and clean. My three children fit in perfectly in the kids room, they main bedroom was big, too, as so was the huge living room, presided by a gorgeous library. The flat has it all, well equipped kitchen, nice dining room, two balconies, two bathrooms.
The location is also perfect: just by the beautiful Vadaparken and next to the subway station of St Eriksplan and many bus stops.
We'll love to repeat the experience.

The girls, especially loved the bunk beds and there are plenty of books and toys to keep children entertained.  The master bedroom faces the street but there is barely any noise.  It was fairly easy to find parking in the neighbourhood, if you have a rental car like we did. 

The apartment is located in a quiet part of Södermalm, but there are plenty of amenities nearby.. the girls loved the playground/park within walking distance and we had spent several nights trying out different restaurants in the neighbourhood.  There is a grocery store just across the street.  You can take a slow stroll to Slussen within 30 minutes or take the number 2 bus that takes you to the same destination in less than 10 minutes.

We did not have any problems. You also have access to all the facilities of the hostel. Would stay here again."

Og med ca. 50-100 meter til strøget i Stockholm, var der meget korte distancer til butikkerne. Godt personale, god lokation, og fedt at der var ekstra badeværelser på stedet. Vi var 10 personer i lejligheden og vi spekulerede derfor på, hvor mange nøgler vi så ville få udleveret.. Men det var super smart med de tal koder, som vi kunne låse os ind med.. En lejlighed der varmt kan anbefales.

There are 3 supermarkets at the metro with ICA kvantum having huge deli section with big range of seafood and many other gourmet things.

To start with Adnan is very responsive. Preparing the arrival and during the stay you got all times replies in minutes. the apartment is fully equipped, furniture store quite new and even the bed was very comfortable  ( compared to the one or the other in quite expensive hotels ). The location is not in the centre which I personally prefer but thanks to the location and the excellent infrastructure of Stockholm it is easy accessible 10 min by feet by metro and even by airport bus directly from Arlanda to Lynholmen station.  Our choice was to do our excuses by public bikes which are easy to rent for some days. You can find the location also close to the metro station.
Again many tanks for the hospitality and 5* recommendation."

Ulrika communicated well in advance and during our stay and her mother in law kindly waited to let us in when we arrived on an evening flight.  A bottle of prosecco left in the fridge was a very nice welcome touch!  

The location was excellent, we could walk to lots of nearby shops and restaurants, and to Gamla Stan and the city centre - or very quickly get the nearby metro.  We also walked to the open air swimming pool on the south of Sodermalm then a beautiful walk along the waterfront, you wouldn't know you were in the city!"

The apartment itself was large and spotlessly clean. It had all the amenities listed and even had a comfortable king sized bed which was a surprise.
The location of the apartment is wonderful. About a three minute walk gets you to transit into the city and also to stores that you would require on a daily basis. Along with these conveniences you are also very close to a beautiful Nature Reserve. It is gorgeous even in the winter!
To sum up, I have to say that our stay at Andreas's flat was absolutely perfect!

Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und sehr ordentlich und bietet wirklich sehr viel Platz. Das Beste ist jedoch die Lage der Wohnung. Nach 4 Minuten Fußweg ist man an der U- Bahn, die  im 5-Minutentakt direkt in die tolle Altstadt von Stockholm fährt und dafür nur 15 Minuten  benötigt . An der U- Bahn Station gibt es auch zwei Lebens-mittelläden mit sehr langen Öffnungszeiten, was wir auch äußerst praktisch fanden. Trotz der guten Anbindung an die Innenstadt liegt die Wohnung sehr ruhig und grenzt an ein Naturschutzgebiet.
Wir können die Wohnung wirklich weiterempfehlen und würden sie  auch selbst gerne für einen nächstes Stockholmurlaub mieten.

It's right near the Nacka nature reservat and we took a walk to lake Söderbysjön which is just beautiful.

Simon was also very accommodating. We didn't meet him in person but he was quick to respond and even found a travel cot and high chair for our 11 month old baby.

We also stayed during the middle of winter and can say that the apartment was super warm and cosy!

Highly recommended!!"

Han välkomnade mig på ett väldigt trevligt och mycket proffsigt sätt efter han hyrt ut rum i sin lägenhet i 13 år. Trots att huset som han bor i härstammar ur miljonprogrammet lyckas Ture kompensera denna faktor med mycket personlig värme och med faktumet att han verkar vara en mycket spännande person som jag gärna skulle fortsatt samtala med. Han berättade för mig att han lagt av i att ställa upp regler åt sina gäster och i stället lita på att gästerna ska ta eget ansvar för deras uppehälle hos honom. Resultatet är ett super rent rum, kök och badrum som jag använde. Tack vare den rätt så stora gården som huset ligger på är det trots det centrala läget mycket lugnt i lägenheten. Tack Ture!"

Really I can highly  recommend Ture, 
I felt safe and welcome!
The place is next to the metro Odenplan, or you can go by feet to the down town, it takes 30 min,

The apartment is warm, pleasant, and clean, and has a small kitchen so you can make light meals as well.

She had prepared the house very clean and cosy, and everything was well communicated upon arrival, when she welcomed me after having given detailed directions how to get there from the airport and from the train station. Also email exchange before and after booking was very fluid and very friendly.

Such a convenient yet calm location makes it possible to discover Sofo, Södermalm and around by foot, and other islands via good public transport connections one reaches within a few minutes walk. The house sits next to a park walkway and playground with deck chairs in the summer, so a lot of children's voices but also nice, lively setting where you can read in the sun. No traffic whatsoever as the house street is a dead end for cars. 1 minute walk away there's a cute bicycle shop renting bikes if you need one.

The house itself had everything you will need for a short stay. Wifi worked well. The kitchen is modestly equipped but works for preparing simple meals.

Sonne Meer und Stockholm, was kann mann sich mehr wünschen?

This was a dream come true for our son and his 3 friends. They spent a \"best ever holiday\" in Kristinas house. Close to the inner city, where you can go shopping and yet: around the corner lake Mälaren where you can have a swim, jump from the cliffs and enjoy the beautiful swedish summer. Stockholm at its best! The House is beautiful, lots of space and light with the most beautiful wiew. The young men had the time of their lifes. Kristina was an excellent host, keept cool when our son got stuck in the middle of nowhere in Sweden and was very flexible about the meeting point. Thank you Kristina, we will most certainly return - next time the whole family!"

The handing over of keys was okay, but Niklas did not have much to recommend. Cleanliness was acceptable. He was new to the apartment so was not super helpful when it came to the laundry service, the neighborhood and more. Throughout my stay, Niklas was reachable through (Hidden by Airbnb) but wasn't always the most helpful and not always very quick at responding. 

The apartment is fantastic for one or two people and I highly recommend someone staying there- especially for a long term stay like mine. It is a nice neighborhood with good access to the metro and city bike and shopping. I was one of Niklas' first renters so I am confident that he will get to know the neighborhood better and be more involved and helpful for future renters."

It’s about a 8-10 minute walk from the closest main thoroughfare (Gotgatan) and the T station we used most to see the rest of Stockholm (Skanstull). It was great to stay in a non-touristy area where it’s easy enough to see the rest of Stockholm. Not to mention that the living room is large and there are 2 separate bedrooms; it had everything we needed for our 7-day stay!"

She also left a sheet with instructions on how to use the washer/dryer and dishwasher, as well as a map which was useful. The listing was accurate and the apartment is very large and comfortable.  The beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of space to store our clothes in the bedrooms.  The apartment is a quick walk to the Stockholm Sodra station and the Skanstull station which took us everywhere we wanted to go.  The apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood and we felt safe walking home at night.  Overall it was a really great experience!"

Good location, easy to get to from the airport, good transport links to the other islands or you can walk. Plenty of nice shops and restaurants near by. Small supermarket across the road. The flat has everything you need for a lovely relaxing stay. My only small criticism was the bed linen. Really small pillows and single duvets for a double bed.

J’ai décidé pour la 1e fois de réserver un appartement sur air bnb pour se sentir dans la peau des locaux. J’ai choisi l’appartement de Pernila parce qu’il était bien placé : pas loin du centre historique en plein cœur du quartier des artistes ! Nous sommes tombés sur la famille extrêmement chaleureuse et accueuillante ! Et nous avons passé un formidable séjour malgré le temps pluvieux. L’appartement est encore meilleur que sur les photos : intérieur cosy, une immense terrasse dans la cour privée qui donne sur Gamla Stan ! Nous avons observé des couchers de soleils splendides !

It was very clean, had nice views and the location, a few steps from a scenic walkway looking across at the old city, was outstanding.  Communication with her was great.  It was convenient to go anywhere in the city.  The place was very comfortable and obviously a home, not just a rental space.  We never crossed paths with Pernilla so we basically had the space all to ourselves.  The cookies and tea she left were a nice touch.  The apartment was easy to find.

Er hat uns eine Liste zur Wohnung zusammen gestellt, in der er alles wichtige oder unklare erklärt hat und stand auch per Mail für Fragen zur Seite.
Die Wohnung befindet sich sehr zentral in Stockholm und lässt sich leicht finden, eine Bushaltestelle liegt 3 Minuten entfernt. Für einen Urlaub zu zweit ist die Größe der Wohnung perfekt. Die Nachbarschaft im Haus ist sehr nett und ruhig.

Living in NYC, space is so limited that being able to come to Stockholm and being able to live in a HUGE living space with a room just as a closet felt like pure luxury.  We absolutely loved the openness, the wide windows to watch the snow falling, and the white walls and linens that made the home feel clean and fresh.  And the fact that the bed had two duvets so that we didn't have to share and could tuck up easily was a plus.

We met up with Amelia and Thomas in the evening and they gave us a taste of Stockholm's nightlife - a lot of fun. They were lovely people and very helpful, giving us lots of tips for our stay. Highly recommend!"
"4113",3384426,44198831,2015-08-24,2270001,"Derek","Amelia and Thomas's loft had a lovely layout and was very well decorated. A very cozy atmosphere. The ceiling windows are a very nice touch. The loft was well situated in the Sodermalm district and we were able to reach our destinations within a 5-20 min walk. Amelia was very easy to reach and communicative from the time we landed in Stockholm to our departure. She even left a handy list of restaurants/bars/sights. Would definitely recommend the loft to any couples or small groups traveling to Stockholm"
"4114",3384426,45148398,2015-08-31,15554042,"Katy","This is a great place to pretend to be a local - I'd love to stay again! Keys were left so that I could arrive late (02:00 with flight delays). The apartment was extremely clean, comfortable, and quiet. The hosts seem like really interesting people with a great eye for design and detail (such as fresh flowers-loved it!). They were also available to quickly answer any questions I had. The location in Sodermalm cannot be beat-I didn't need to use public transit once (except for the airport express), but there are train stations right around the corner. On my very long list of cafes, shops, sights and museums I wanted to visit, most were within 5-20 minutes walk and the furthest (the super fascinating Nordiska Museet) was less than an hour's walk with plenty to see and discover on the way. Amelia's guidebook had some great recommendations-I was especially grateful for the tip to walk around the corner to Monteliusvägen for a beautiful sunset :)"
"4115",3384426,46022437,2015-09-07,28758999,"Kyle","Amelia and Thomas were very helpful and attentive, offering to help with Restaurant choices, sites to see as well as transportation options from the airport. 

The apartment was very nice, provides enough space and good sunlight. It is located in a central area with many things to do and restaurants to choose from. 

I am very happy with our choice and would recommend the apartment to others.

I had significant travel delays getting to Stockholm, but they were very easy to keep in touch with and did everything they could to accommodate what became a hectic schedule. Once I made it to town, not only was the apartment beautiful, clean, and perfectly located but they were prepared with a list of attractions off the beaten path that helped make my trip to Stockholm one of my best ever vacations. I would highly recommend Amelia and Thomas!"

Selvom den lå centralt i byen var der meget roligt og stille om natten i weekenden, hvilket vi virkelig nød. Amalia var hurtigt til at svare på mails,og var sød til at hjælpe med at finde gode restauranter. Vil helt klart anbefale den til venner som vil til Stockholm. Perfekt:-)"

I can't recommend them highly enough as hosts - they made us feel so welcome, and were only a text away if we needed anything. Their apartment is in a great neighbourhood with lots to do and so central that you can walk to lots of places or just hop on the underground. We loved it so much we were sorry to have to come home...

The house was very clean and perfect for a weekend stay. It was a great location too - cute coffee/brunch spots on the street and walking distance to lots of trendy restaurants. We could also walk to the ferry dock to be able to catch the boats to the islands. Loved our time!"

"4124",3385563,43548451,2015-08-20,24075472,"Bernd","Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt in der wunderschönen, zentral gelegenen und dennoch ruhigen Wohnung. Die Ausstattung, das Flair, die Umgebung, alles war wie beschrieben. Sara hat uns gute Tipps für die nähere Umgebung (Einkaufsmöglichkeiten, Cafés, Metro) gegeben, sodass wir uns sofort gut zurecht gefunden haben. Der Kontakt war sehr nett, die Schlüsselübergabe verlief problemlos. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und können die Wohnung nur weiterempfehlen."
"4125",3385563,44049005,2015-08-23,16399865,"Jenna","My friend and I were surprised by our experience at Sara's flat. She Did not show up upon arrival (which was fine) but failed to provide any ground rules or suggestions. Did not show us where to dispose of the garbage. She left her plants all over her small apartment (at least 10+), which made it hard to move around. We couldn't even move the plants ourselves Bc there was no room for us to put them. The washroom is incredibly small. Sink wasn't even large enough for us to wash our hands. For that reason, we used the only table available in her small studio apartment to place our toiletries bag on. I understand she lives in her apartment, however, she had so much of her own stuff in the apartment that it made it nearly impossible for us to place our belongings and luggage anywhere. She did make any room for us to actually take things out of our luggage. This made our stay very uncomfortable and crammed."
"4126",3385563,45146394,2015-08-31,38384182,"Jack","My partner and I both loved Sara's place. It had a very comfortable feel and was so well located to public transport, a grocery store, coffee, food/beverage and great sites. Was a shame to find out that the laundry service was down, however we could have asked this before hand."

"4129",3385563,49057057,2015-09-30,5776006,"David","This is a beautiful apartment, Sara is a very stylish person and the flat definitely reflects that. It is very bright, we loved waking up to Scandinavian sunshine through the large windows, and the plants add an enjoyably botanical feel to the place.
Sara also gave us some great recommendations for Södermalm, including a great cafe that we visited every morning. The area around the apartment is calm and quiet, and a short walk from fabulous views across Stockholm. 
I'd say this is a great flat for one person. The bed is on the small side for two people, unless you're both small and enjoy being super-cosy!"
"4130",3385563,50039581,2015-10-08,2669127,"Karsten","I can highly recommend staying with Sara. The apartment is super nice and in a great location - really close to many beautiful spots in the city, right next to an amazing park with water view.
If there's one thing that doesn't live up to these very high standards, it's the bathroom - it's tiny and not very practical."

Fredrik ist glaube ich so mit einer der entspanntesten Leute überhaupt. Unkompliziert, freundlich und hilfsbereit. Wir hatten ein paar coole Gespräche über das Film-Business & er inspirierte mich mit den Speisen die er Abends immer so für sich kochte & backte.

Good kitchen to cook and a nicely decorated livingroom to chill out. Supermarket, busstop and subway around the corner. Although Malin wasn`t there herself, her brother was there to hand me the keys. In communication Malin was  quick in respons and very friendly. I could stay my last day untill four o` clock, which was very nice because I had a flight at eight o`clock. Even when Malin was away she was a nice host. I would recommend Stockholm and the apartment."

"4191",3404071,31388991,2015-05-04,31374951,"Sharat","- Astrid's bright and clean home was my second experience with airbnb, and it was even better than the first. Astrid was very helpful from the inception of my reservation to handling any inquiries that I had during my trip. Her airbnb apt profile has all the information you would need to get to her place, and perhaps with a little assistance from (Hidden by Airbnb) maps if you make a wrong turn in Södermalm. Both Astrid and her husband Magnus were incredibly friendly and spent almost an hour giving me a tour of their apt, describing the hotspots in their neighborhood and trying to understand what would be beneficial for me to see in my limited time in Stockholm.

- The location was perfect as it was exceptionally close to the social areas and shops of Sodermalm, but it was a few streets removed so that you were not exposed to late night noise from the nearby bars. There are several tasty restaurants and cafe's within a 15 minute walk of their home, and there are also a handful of grocery stores (and 7elevens) within a few streets of their apt.

- The apartment is in a beautiful and trendy area of Södermalm, and within Södermalm it's in a very quiet section across from a spectacular hilltop church (Sofia Kyrka). The building is a relatively nondescript structure with a simple central elevator - I used the stairs since it was quicker for me (and it was only 3-4 flights).

- The interior of their home was very bright and airy with the living room facing the church, while the bedroom faced the quiet rear of the building and overlooked the building's garden area. Their home looked recently renovated with a modern kitchen and bathroom, and the home was kept very clean. I never really used the living area, though for a family or a couple the space would be ideal (there is a nice size dining table and a comfy sofa and tv). There is a well-stocked builtin bookshelf in the wall separating the living room and the rest of the home, though most of the books were in Swedish.

- The apartment was also stocked sufficiently with supplies (toilet paper, paper towel and cleaning solutions), and Astrid and Magnus had the bed fitted with clean sheets/duvet cover and also provided clean towels.

- Overall, I had a great experience at Astrid and Magnus' home, and would highly recommend staying there. Not only is their home great, but they were exceptionally nice people and enhanced my trip to Sweden."
"4192",3404071,38490778,2015-07-16,13163135,"Erin","Overall we had a good experience at Astrid's place. It is in a very nice location and was clean and quiet. Check in was easy and Astrid was easy to communicate with throughout our stay.

There are a couple of things that Astrid could improve on. We were unaware when we booked that we would be expected to thoroughly clean the apartment (vacuum and scrub) upon leaving. I think that Astrid should make this expectation more clear on the listing because it definitely is not the norm on Airbnb. I always leave places tidy, but having to vacuum and scrub was more work than we expected.

The apartment could also be a bit tidier. The surfaces were clean, but there was a lot of clutter (much more than in the listing photos) I think due to Astrid not being home in between guests. Some things were not in the exact place that Astrid described in her listing.

I recommend this listing, as long as you are aware that you are expected to thoroughly clean before leaving."

The room is exactly as pictured, and the apartment is truly charming! Very clean, too. Though I spent most of my days out exploring the city, I did get to chat with Monica and she even invited me to have dinner with her book club one night, an experience I will never forget.

The room was as described and comfortable with everything you needed. As was the rest of the flat. The location was brilliant, a little out of the touristy area so it felt like the 'real' Stockholm. The bus stop was very close as was a supermarket and places to eat.  There were parks nearby as well.

Besides she gave some nice tips for Stockholm. The apartment is just as nice as in the pictures and I felt home immediately. You will need some time from the city center to Åstra, but I enjoyed the calm environment after spending a whole day in busy Stockholm. A little Forrest is just behind the house, so you can go out for a walk. Before you come to Monica's house, you should read about the SL access system of Stockholm. I didn't do that and came to her house without a card for the public transport. You cannot get a card or refill them on a bus, but a store which charges cards isn't far away. Monica saved me by lending her card to me :)"

The house was wonderfully equipped and in a very calm area of Stockholm, despite not being far from the city center.

We spent three nights in Katerina's wonderful Sodermalm apartment. I am so glad that this was my first Airbnb experience. Katerina is fantastic, she replied quickly when I messaged her and our booking was smooth and hassle-free. She gave clear directions to her flat and made us feel very welcome when we arrived. The flat itself is clean, comfortable and cosy with original parquet floors and attractive vintage-style decorating. It is amazingly quiet, no street noise (it overlooks a tranquil green courtyard) and we didn't hear any neighbours for our entire stay. The bed is lovely and comfy and the shower is great with excellent water pressure. The kitchen is basic, but had everything we needed. The location is perfect for exploring Stockholm. Lots of independent bars, cafes, restaurants, a park, supermarkets and interesting little shops are on your doorstep. There is a great waterside walk a few minutes away. Katerina will point you in the right direction! Gamlastan (the old town) is a pleasant 30 minute walk or just 3 stops on the metro. The nearest station is a mere three minutes away, but we didn't bother with public transport as everything is really easy to get to on foot. Stockholm is a marvellous city and we will hopefully visit again. When we do, we will definitely be going back to Katerina's!"

Depuis le premier contact par écrit, Kajsa s'est montrée très accueillante avec nous, nous donnant une foule de détails utiles et qui laissaient déjà présumer de l'agréable séjour que nous allions passer. 

Grace à ses indications précises, nous avons trouvé sans difficulté depuis l'aéroport l'appartement où Kajsa nous attendait avec un grand sourire :-). Très désireuse de nous aider à prendre nos marques, nous avons pu profiter de ses conseils avisés sur les quelques centres d'intérêt dont nous lui avons fait part. 

Sinon, l'appartement était parfait pour notre séjour d'une semaine ! Propre, pratique, super calme, Idéalement situé, au coeur d'un quartier très sympa et dynamique. nous avons trouvé de chouettes endroits où nous restaurer, prendre un verre, pique niquer avec des vues magnifiques, tout cela à quelques minutes à pied ! 

Nous avions aussi tous les transports (métro, tram, bus) à portée de main ; se déplacer dans une ville n'a jamais été aussi simple !

En bref, nous sommes ravies du séjour que nous avons passé à Stockholm, et nous vous recommandons ce logement les yeux fermés :) Merci Kajsa :)"

Mikael was very responsive and gave us all the information needed. Although he was abroad he made sure we were welcomed by his friend who handed us the keys. 

The minute we came in we felt at home! The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. Mikael had a bottle of prosecco waiting for us, a nice surprise. The apartement was cosy and located just across the metro station for easy access to other parts of Stockholm. The neighbourhood is the trendy Sofo, with some nice coffee bars and shops close by. 
The metro takes you in a few minutes to Nordermalm en Ostermalm or the central station. Drop coffee around the corner is a nice minimalistic place to start the day with great coffee. Just a few blocks away you will find Urban Deli, a great place to buy food and eat the night away. Great cocktails and good vibes.

One more thing that might be worth telling is the bed is not too big, perfect for newly weds:-)

If you are not on holliday with your lovely  partner, sleeping on the floor on a very thin additional mattress with not very fresh smelling sheets  is inevitably. A night cover for the eyes is a must becouse there are no curtains on the window and the sun there  rises in the middle of the nigh.  The towels are included in the price, but unfortunately only one per person for whole week. Absolutely not enough. Exept the dirty dishes ant not very clean floor  all the rest was acceptable.  

Unfortunately the owner is always very busy. I did not succeed to meet him. No problem. He will read my comments here"

The flat itself is beautiful and had everything we needed - and yes, the bed is small for two people, but we managed with no problems! And while we never had the pleasure of meeting Nicolas, his laid-back attitude, trust in us and hospitality even from afar was so appreciated.

The location offers easy access to the main attractions of Stockholm via (very reliable and frequent bus), while providing a lovely respite from the hustle and bustle. There is a very nice grocery store about a 5 minute walk away, with high quality produce, meat, and other items. The flat itself gets tons of light and is bright and airy. The living room glass doors allow a perfect breeze to freshen the space. The kitchen is a good size for cooking and  Celine has it stocked with all of the equipment you need. We enjoyed our daily \"fika\" using the French press and the great coffee Celine provided to us. There is also a charming little private terrace where Celine keeps a bountiful potted garden of herbs and a few vegetables...I loved the routine of watering the plants every day and dining al fresco was wonderful!

The surrounding neighbourhood and transport facilities are as advertised, which means that both doing groceries and getting to our daily destinations were a pleasure. In addition, there is a small park nearby that offers a playground and even the opportunity to do some sledding. Again, a great environment for keeping young children busy and happy.

Last but not least, Martin and his wife were great hosts who were very helpful whenever we needed something or had some questions.

Carina es una enamorada del diseño y se nota en toda la casa. Cuando abres la puerta sabes que pasarás mas tiempo en ella del que tenías previsto pq es una casa maravillosa. Con una luz sensacional y vistas al parque. Con un salón enorme, un sofá muy muy cómodo, una televisión Samsung grandisima, un equipo de sonido BOSE, todo supernuevo y cuidado hasta el máximo detalle. La cocina incluye todos los adelantos y todo el menaje que necesites. Además es preciosa. La habitación de matrimonio es suficientemente grande y la cama de matrimonio es enorme. Además para los europeos del sur tiene la ventaja de que tiene estores. La habitación adicional es pequeña pero mas que suficiente. La terraza es enormemente agradable, da a un patio interior donde los vecinos (todos muy cool) desayunan los fines de semana. El baño es súper limpio y tiene todo el equipamiento. Las toallas son mas pequeñas que en España, pero limpias y en fantástico estado. Tiene lavadora y secadora. Todos los electrodomésticos, del baño y la cocina, son nuevos y de la marca Siemens. 
La impresión de la escalera y el ascensor es menos buena que la de la casa, pq esta es tan chula, que la escalera, ascensor y entrada, que son mas humildes.

Carina ha sido encantadora, dispuesta a recomendarnos restaurantes, nos pidió el taxi para el aeropuerto y nos trajo todo lo necesario para el desayuno del primer día!!!! Es un encanto de mujer. Te da su teléfono para que la llames cuando quieras. 
El barrio está cerca del lago, del ayuntamiento. A ambos lugares, 15 y 20 min andando. Y cerca del centro y del resto de barrios que se visitan. Tb cerca de la estación central.

En suma, muy muy recomendable el apartamento y Carina. Para un matrimonio con dos hijos pequeños es PERFECTO!! El precio es alto, pero el apartamento y el mimo de Carina lo merece sin duda. GRACIAS Carina!!!!"

The building itself was lovely and the fourth floor balcony overlooking the inner courtyard was a very relaxing place to sit after a day of walking the city.  Note for those with any mobility issues that the elevator is very small and the fourth floor walkup involves spiral stairs.  Not a problem for us; just added to the overall ambiance of the experience."

Josefin herself was great and friendly: I couldn't have asked a better host for my first Airbnb experience because she answered to all my questions clearly and quickly and made sure we had the keys + introduced the place when we arrived.

It was easy to reach her and arrange a time to check in, even though we did not have cell phone service in Sweden. Her place is nice and open with big windows, a comfortable bed, a sofa bed, and everything you need to cook a good meal. The apartment, furniture, and decor might not be as fancy and updated as that of other listings, but it is a good value and the location is convenient. We rented a car and it was quick to get to the city from her place."

In conclusion, I would recommend that apartment to my friends.

It took us only 20 min to the old town (gamla stan) and the central station (you need only one metro). She also gave us a description to her apartment so we did'nt have troubls to find it!

We stayed as a family of 5 (kids are 7, 5 and 1 yrs ) and it was perfect. 2 children were on the sofa bed and Josefin supplied an extra matress for the toddler. I'd recommend to any families wanting somewhere good for young kids. What is particularly good is that the block of apartments has a small play area just outside the front door. The other families come out to play and after a long day of sightseeing, the kids just enjoyed kicking back in the playground. You do need to go up 3 flights of stairs but they are short and wide so we didn't find it a problem.

The location is really nice; straight out of the subway are supermarkets and a bakery so it's easy to pick up all the things you need for the day. It a short walk (about 5 mins) to the apartment but all very safe and buggy friendly. 

The metro goes frequently and within 15 mins you can be on a boat to Djurgarden or in the old town. There are lifts and escalators to make it easy to get buggies and luggage through the station.

Would definitely recommend."

Fabulous location and a lovely areas. There is a small grocery store on the corner of the street and some fabulous cafes close by. We were travelling with 2 children so the big park across the road was a fabulous bonus too. It's position is near the bus stop and an easy walk to the metro system.

The apartment was neat and had what we required. We didn't use any equipment ( TV or oven) but the washer and dryer were great and easy to work out. Dinuke left a small amount of tourist info for us too.  There wasn't a lot of space for our luggage though which was a little difficult but we made it work.

This home is in a lovely neighborhood with quiet walking paths nearby and a wonderful restaurant recommended by our host within walking distance.  The home was just as described and was perfect for our family of 4.  Everyone could spread out into their own room, play ping pong, Wii, watch TV, play the piano, listen to music, or read on the deck.  The kitchen was well stocked and we prepared most of our meals at the house.  We truly felt like it was our \"home away from home\" and appreciate the opportunity to have stayed here."

The house is beautiful, spacious and has every thing youcould possibly need and much more. Our teenage son was delighted with the pool table and table tennis which was great fun for us all.
The location of the house is excellent , having the Lake with dive platform so close meant we could take good dips whenever we wanted . The lake was also great for kayaking we hired from just across the bridge- they were helpful and friendly.
Also location to Stovkholm was brilliant and the transport infrastructure is brilliant and easy to use.
We had a great holiday that went way to quickly, the Swedish people were so helpful and friendly. It was our fist trip to Sweden and I loved it can't wait to go back.
Cinnamon buns fantastic though my daughter insists the apple pie is even better!

The location was excellent - a stone throw away from the commuter train and very close to the metro as well. The neighborhood boasts some of the best cafes in town (so if you're a coffee lover, you'll be very happy). Sodermalm itself is probably the best place to stay while in Stockholm. Not only does the area itself have a lot to offer, I was able to just walk to the historic center or take a ferry to Djurgardsvagen from Sodermalm.  Fredrik was very helpful from the moment I made my booking, and his apartment was clean and cozy. The guest room was spacious and quiet. The bed was very comfortable. It was a pleasure getting to know Fredrik and his interesting work, too! Since Fredrik works from home most of the time, he's a very present host and he's around to offer recommendations or help that you may need."

The room was comfortable, cosy, spacious and very clean, like the rest of the appartment. We had a private bathroom and could use the kitchen and the lovely balcony for having breakfast.  We were extremely pleased with the location of the appartment, in the centre of wonderful Södermalm. Calm surrounding, yet with plenty of restaurants and cafés nearby.  The train and metro station were just around the corner, as was the City bikes station. Last nut not least we enjoyed the warm company of our host Fredrik. He was such a nice person, friendly, wise, relaxed and gifted with a great sense of humour.  He was quick in responding to our mails, helpful in finding out information about the city and very flexible as to our arrival and departure time.  For example, we could leave our luggage in the appartment until our plane left late in the afternoon.  We could not have wished a better home in our favourite city in Europe. We will surely come back to Stockholm and would love to stay with Fredrik again.

He offered us the use of our own WC to use during our stay, and then a shared shower facility. 
The location is ideal, close to all transport links, however the location is that good can almost walk most places from the apartment as we found. The area has plenty of character, lots of places to grab a coffee, or have a drink, evening meal. 
Frederik himself was incredibly hospitable to the point in which it felt we were staying at a friends home.

The appartment itself was lovely, spacious, stylish, well equipped and comfortable. The wifi worked really well. Our 7 year old daughter loved playing with some of the toys. The area is very quiet and peaceful, but is only a short walk from shops, cafes, bars and transportation. It is a great base from which to explore Stockholm, and it easy to walk into the old town and the ferry to Djurgarden. Pers recommendations in his airbnb guidebook are also really useful. The food in his cafe is great!"

Also the subway stations were only a couple of minutes away and offered a perfect connection to all main attractions and parts of Stockholm.
Per prepared everything perfectly for our arrival and always replied as soon as possible if we had a question or similar. It's always a good feeling to know somebody is there in an emergency (of any kind)!
Last but not least the beds were extremely comfortable,  the apartment was  very quiet  and the blinds made it easy to sleep in the light Swedish summer nights!

The location is perfect, in the middle of Sodermalm yet quiet and private. Per was a great host, answering any questions promptly and his suggestions of things to see and do were great. We had our two kids with us aged 4 and 7 and they loved their great room filled with toys! We loved our private balcony overlooking a lovely internal courtyard.

Raj typically works night shifts (which was fine with me) but was there to greet me when I arrived at around 11:30am. The place is in an easy location to the T-bahn (metro) and was nice to come home to a very comfortable bed after a long day walking around the city. Raj was a kind host, had food for guests to use and even offered to drive me with my bags to the bus station in Centrum for my departure (which I accepted). I really liked Stockholm and Raj's place is perfect for those who wish to enjoy what Stockholm has to offer!"

I found it quite easy to take public transportation into the more touristy parts of the city (Gamla Stan) - it only took about 10-15 minutes for me to get from Raj's house to restaurants or sites I wanted to see. Raj also helped me find a wonderful running path that I really enjoyed. As others have mentioned, he offered me rides, food, and suggestions - he truly is a wonderful host.

He took me for a bike ride and a walk in different, beautiful areas of Stockholm, that I could never have seen without him. His house is well-situated in a very quiet, green area. The metro is 5 minutes walk and the line goes direct to the center (only 5-10 minutes away). Raj made every effort to make my stay as pleasant as possible. He provided food for a generous breakfast (coffee, teas, juices, yogurts, bread, butter, cheese, honey, jam, muesli…and so on!). Both bedroom and bathroom are perfect.

We stayed there for 3 nights. It was wonderful. The house is spacious, clean and tidy. We love the decoration and design. You can see the sunbeam and stars through the rooftop window.  The bed is very big and comfortable. We managed to get a very good sleep after a long day of sight-seeing. All electronics are in good condition.

It was my 4th time visiting the city and this apartment has been, so far, the best one. I will definitely come back to Stockholm and I will choose his apartment again.

This apartment is amazing. The deck is awesome, everything is spotless, and it has a lot of great space with wonderful light. I also really enjoyed Jacob's style! I kept feeling like I was in my good friend's apartment because so much of the art and decoration resonated with me.

We had a mishap of our own making and Jacob was wonderful in helping us work it all out even though we were back in Canada.

The living area is big, with plenty of natural light and the balcony was nice in the evenings. The location was also perfect with plenty of shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars within walking distance. There was some construction work going on at the adjacent building that was quite loud at 8am each morning but that's a temporary issue. Stockholm is a beautiful city, and I highly recommend staying at Jacobs if you plan to visit."

Jacob's apartment is lovely.  His kitchen is very well appointed with the added delight of beautiful dishware and glassware.  
The location of the apartment was perfect. We were a short walk over the bridge from Gamla Stan - an easy 10-15 walk.  The area of the apartment - Sodermalm - has a great vibe.  We were within walking distance of a grocery store, a great restaurant, \" Akkurat\" on Hornsgatan and a few blocks from the liquor store where beer and wine along with heavier stuff are sold.  
Jacob is a great communicator!  He was easy to work with to make no-stress check in and out arrangements.  
In addition I'd like to suggest a couple of other great restaurants we found Kryp-In in Gamla Stan and the restaurant at the Spirit Museum!  Make reservations for both.

The cottage is very quaint and beautiful, and as described located in a small neighborhood outside of Stockholm. It was nice for us because we were there for a conference at Stockholmsmässen, so it was very convenient (about a 15 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride to the conference center). It is a pretty small space for two people, but it was really nice to have our own kitchen to have breakfast in, closets, etc - much better than staying in a very small hotel room. The neighborhood is very quiet and convenient to a few decent restaurants and several grocery stores (and Stockholmsmässen!) and Stockholm is very easy to access by bus and train (it takes 40 minutes - 1 hour door-to-door, typically, but the trains are very reliable so it's easy to plan trips). I would recommend anyone to stay here if they are looking for a nice place a little bit outside of the bustle of the city."

You can very easily walk to public transportation that'll take you to everywhere in Stockholm (~5 min walk to train station from this flat). The room itself is exactly like the photo - a bit small, but still comfortable with 2 beds, windows, some drawer/ hanging space for your clothes (and quick and reliable Wifi). Svante and Tatjana are kind enough to provide sheets, pillows, comforters, and towels as well. The bathroom is also very clean. The area feels very safe to stay in, and it's very quiet at night.

This place is really nice if you're just looking for somewhere to stay and as we were out most of the time this worked well for us. The only drawback is that there is no kitchen, just a fridge in the hallway, but as we were only there for two nights it wasn't really a problem for us. All in all, good room, nice hosts."

The room is cosy and they provided us towels for the shower and cups of tea which is really nice when you arrived to rest a bit or after a long day visiting Stockholm. Even a hair dryer is available!!
The room is indeed separated from svante and tatjana's flat but you can ask us for anything they will help you. Easy access to stockholm with transports, bus or subway are really near the flat. If you stay for a week, we recommend you to buy the one week access card to all SL transport, it's 300 SEK (about 32 or 33€) but it's worth it.
Svante and Tatjana thanks for the stay."

The room was a good size for two people (and even better for just little old me...), the bed firm but comfy, the blankets warm & fresh, the shared shower roomy with lots of hot water, some room in the shared refrigerator for my snacks and they even set up a teapot with tea for the room. The space is a short walk from several bus lines and the subway and there are also several great eateries nearby as well, all in a very nice neighborhood. Tatjana & Svante were very kind and helpful, especially when I arrived much later than expected due to a flight delay.

We were also given very clear and easy to follow directions for when we arrived.
The location is only a 10 minute train journey to the city centre and close to some nice cafés and restaurants. I recommend Svante and Tatjana's home and will definitely stay there in the future."

The balcony overlooking the courtyard of her building made us want to stay in Stockholm forever. Just lovely! We really enjoyed the Sodermalm neighborhood - there were great restaurants, coffee shops and parks all over. Check out “Meatballs for the People” for dinner if you can. It was only about a 25-minute walk or a very short metro ride to Gamla Stan (the Old Town), which was beautiful. Elsa was a great host and very accommodating! Thanks Elsa!"

We definitely love her apartment! She decorated her apartment very well with all sorts of visual arts and small details are nicely arranged as well.

Her apartment: -
She has a well equipped kitchen with all basic cooking necessity. We love spending time just around the dining area, or simply sit on the sofa in the living room beside the kitchen. The bedroom's balcony overlooking the courtyard is very nice & cozy but we hardly spend time there since when we around, it rains quite a few days.

The building for the apartment according to Elsa was since 1930s but it is well maintained and I find the old-fashioned 2-doors lift very interesting.

The neighbourhood: -
It takes us around 6~7mins walking from Skanstull station (exit the Ringvägen direction). Sometime we took the bus. It's just 2mins away by bus. 

On Saturday, we went around the neighbourhood and not hard to find that there's a stretch of open market within the neighbourhood. There's a nice cafe near to Elsa's apartment that serves good cinnamon roll and slightly further we found a very good restaurant for dinner as well.

We love the apartment and the accessible neighbourhood. So much things to do in this neighbourhood, but we have so little time to explore. Will definitely come back again!

Thanks Elsa for the host! We enjoyed staying in your cozy apartment!"
"4600",3770117,48950441,2015-09-29,6777423,"Nga","We had an absolutely wonderful time in Stockholm at Elsa's apartment which is (without a doubt) the nicest place we've ever stayed at through airbnb. The apartment was not only impeccably and tastefully furnished (with cozy, colorful vintage-y furnishings from around the world), it was larger than I expected, spotlessly clean, bright and airy (I love the big windows throughout), and was a lovely place to come home to every day. In fact, the hardest part about Elsa's apartment was having to leave it at the end of our stay :) There were so many things I loved about Elsa's apartment, including (a) her big, comfy bed, (b) the balcony where we sat and enjoyed the night air after a long day of traipsing around Stockholm with our baby daughter in tow, (c) the elevator in the building (which was incredibly useful for our stroller/pram) and (d) the layout of the apartment, with the front rooms (living room, kitchen) facing the street and the back rooms (bedroom, bathroom) facing the quieter inner courtyard. The only real challenge for us (with a one year old) were the short flight of stairs separating the front rooms from the back, which was a bit scary with a toddler (our baby did fall down the stairs once, but luckily she landed on her butt :). Otherwise, we had a perfect stay at Elsa's. Elsa herself was warm and welcoming and even made room for our clothes and things in her closet and cupboards (which many airbnb hosts do not do), which was a very nice touch since I love being able to unpack my bags and feel at home when I'm on the road (rather than feel like I'm living out of my suitcase the whole time cause there's no where to put my things). All in all, we had a wonderful time at Elsa's place and hope to stay there again on our next trip to Stockholm."

The apartment is designed and styled in such a way that instantly makes you feel very comfortable and relaxed - very zen like experience. The morning light from the bedroom window with the attached terrace is really amazing. I'm having withdrawals just typing about it! 

The apartment is centrally located in one of the best areas of Stockholm - Full of restaurants, cafés, bars, shops and markets. Very safe and well-lit area, so you'll always feel safe walking at night. We constantly found ourselves discovering a new coffee shop to try or restaurant to scope out every time we took a different turn. Very close to the train/subway, and a short walk to the bridge connecting Sodermalm to Gamla Stan (take in the view on the walk over!)

Elsa was one of the best hosts we've ever experienced. Very attentive, full of information and incredible details, and just very sweet and comforting. She made us feel right at home the moment we met her.

Her communication was prompt and she seemed liked the nicest person, I wish I could have met her in person. Her place is very conveniently located only a few stops (10-15min) outside of Stockholm's city centre, and was also very easy to reach upon my arrival from the airport. Her apartment is located in a very charming part of Stockholm away from the business, but still so close you can reach everywhere you want to go in just minutes. The apartment itself is equipped with a comfortable bed + couch, great bathroom (with an amazing shower), and a kitchen that makes it very easy to prepare a wonderful breakfast before heading out on the town.

The location is very good.  The area is quite calm and even though is not centre of Stockholm is quite close to the metro station and from there is a 15 min ride to Stockholm T-centralen or Gamla Stan.
Tess was super nice. She gave us all the necessary directions and picked us at the metro station. She introduced us a little bit too the area and to Stockholm and gave also some good tips about the city. 
I would highly recommend this place and will definitely will stay there when I'm back to Stockholm."

Tess was such a nice host, she picked us up from the subway station and showed us the way to the apartment and how to use the stove etc. There was everything alright, in case of any problem or emergency we would have been able to call her (never had to though). 
We would definitely recommend staying at Tess' place when visiting beautiful Stockholm! :)"

The apartment is beautiful, very light and clean and felt like the perfect home to stay!"

Tess is very kind. And she positively contributed  to our first stay in Stockholm.  Thanks Tess!"

Very appreciated! The apartment itself is lovely and full of moden conveniences. There is a bus stop right across the road, and a large supermarket and subway station are within easy walking distance. Everything we needed - highly recommended!"

Flat is typically Scandinavian - bright, open and clean. Very minimalistic. Kitchenware is lacking, but it's good enough to make oneself some breakfast. Location is really comfortable."

I let my mother bring one. The apartment is like a modern art gallery without paintings. A very clean, almost sterile, location with a high end finish. The bedroom is like a tree-cabin adventure. Our morning breakfast we got just across the street and diner was perfect in the restaurant next to it. Cabs stop in front of the apartment - only take the official Stockholm Taxi. And for late night shopping the 7/11 is just around the corner. A walk to the city center and harbor is within reach by walking +/- 10 minutes. A great place to stay if you are for business in Stockholm. Tip for future users: the WiFi router is located in the cupboard in the closet of the entrance hall. The cupboard has a metal cover that prevents the signal reaching the kitchen table. Just open the metal cover during your stay and the signal strength maximizes!"

Firstly, the location is one of the best in Stockholm, very central and across the street from one of my favorite IT restaurants in Stockholm.

The apartment was exactly as described and exceeded our expectations. Therese met us at the apartment and unfortunately had to wait for us for much longer than expected as our plane was late but she wasn't at all worried by being held up. She made us feel very welcome and described everything for us and left us great notes on how things worked, where to buy groceries etc.  The neighbourhood is great. Lovely walks nearby, close to the bus (right outside the door), nice local restaurants and we felt very safe walking around.  Therese gave us great information on which tickets were available for buses and sightseeing passes. I would thoroughly recommend staying with Therese. The apartment was really warm too!"

Therese left clear instructions along with clean towels and sheets as well as free access to the coffee machine, which was a nice touch! Strong wifi signal as well.

The 2 bus stop is right outside, very convenient for getting into town, while the tube is just a short walk away - but the street itself is quiet, as were the neighbours during the time I was there.

The shower is a little small, as is the bed if there's two of you."

She provided clear instructions to/from the airport, nearest grocery store, liquor store and bus stop, tips on great views of the city steps from her door, wifi information and coordinated an ideal, stress-free transfer of keys. 

Her home was well equipped with all of the necessary kitchen essentials (utensils, pots and pans, towels, etc) and was ideally located for our itinerary that spanned Sodermalm, Gamla Stan, Norrmalm and Djurgarden. The #2 drops you right in front of her doorstep - a dream after a long day of tourism.

The area is brilliant as well, especially if you love going out for breakfast in some of some of Stockholm's hip and trendy places. There are also some great shops for vintage clothes. All in all we had the best time and could not recommend Therese and her flat highly enough. Thanks!!

The neighborhood was lovely though not very central (we took buses to visit touristic points). We also thought the bed was rather narrow and the blanket was not enough for 2 persons.

The bedroom is very comfortable, as well as the living room and the balcony. The apartment is well equipped with kitchen and a dining room. The bathroom is big with shower/tub and mirror. Everything is very clean. The location is really convenient. Maybe 2 min walk from the subway station with supermarket and restaurants close by. Also, they are close to the coast. Do not miss the opportunity to take a walk there. 
Karin and Xavier are excellent hosts. Prior to arrive they sent me a guide of Stockholm they prepared. We had good conversation, good laughs and some drinks together. Highly recommend spend some time with them."

Even if they are social, we almost never noticed them because they respected our privacy during the two nights we spent there.
They are flexible with the kitchen and bathroom to make it easier for everyone. The bed sofa is really comfortable and the room is big enough with your own desk =) which is good if you have to study. A nice and fresh apartment with a balcony!

The apartment had everything I needed for a three month stay. The kitchen was fully equipped with all cooking utensils; there was plenty of closet space; a comfortable bed; a modern bathroom with extra towels; and excellent laundry facilities in the basement of the building. The Wifi connection was good and stayed reliable.
 
The location is in a nice, safe neighborhood with lots of trees and walking paths, and the building has its own yard with a picnic area to relax in at the end of the day. I found the neighbors very welcoming, and enjoyed several conversations with them on the small porch overlooking the garden.
 
One thing that I highly valued was the easy access to the local transport system. There is a staffed subway (T-Bana) stop and a city bus stop just a minute away.  This made getting around Stockholm a breeze, and moving luggage and groceries much easier. Within a few short stops, you can be at Gamla Stan in about 10 minutes. Both of the T-Bana stops to the North and South have large grocery stores within a 2 to 3 minute walk, and there is a large shopping mall just one stop away.

In short, a fantastic stay in Stockholm, and I highly recommend this rental!

There are also a bunch of cafés and restaurants in the neighborhood and a grocery store about two blocks away.

The apartment is meticulously renovated, the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, and the bedroom, every detail has been taken care of and gives us so much coziness. The kitchen is as good as brand new, and all the facilities, including the fridge, the hob, the hood, the dishwashers are all  of highest quality and extremely good condition. We bought some ingredients from nearby supermarket and cooked a few dinners and it's really enjoyable to cook there! 

The bath room has very good design, creating space and comfort. The heated floor definitely helped to overcome the cold weather to us, who flied from Singapore, a tropical country. 

The SONOS audio system works great, with easy installation of the app on your own phone. it can stream music from his library or your own phone to multiple rooms, with different streams at the same time! Apple TV is a great add-on, I used it to watch the live broadcast of a national event I couldn't miss. 

The location of the apartment is great,  which is just a few minutes to the nearest metro, and  it can take you easily going anywhere. Though the building is on a small hill, there is escalator and elevator nearby to help you move up and down, which is great for us with a baby stroller. The small lift in the building also helps us a lot too.

The apartment wouldn't be amazing if not for the great host, Espen. He was actually visiting my region when I am in Stockholm, so he prepared everything I needed/requested beforehand, such as SIM card, the bicycle child seat, and many great instructions/notes/recommendations. For things not so straightforward, such as the SIM card I needed, he took the pains to do the research and called the service provider a few times to help me to find the most cost effective solution based on my needs. Even when he was on his own trip, upon my request, he remotely loaded some money to help me to add more data package.  What a service!

I would highly recommend Espen's apartment to anyone who is visiting Stockholm. It's so fortunate to stay there in the beautiful city. At the end of the week's stay, it's pretty sad that we have to leave this place. But I what I am sure is that as long as we are coming back to Stockholm, we will choose no other place to stay. :)"

Espen hat uns im Vorfeld der Reise viele Informationen über seine Wohnung zur Verfügung gestellt und auch während unseres Aufenthaltes alle Fragen umgehend beantwortet. Er war ein überaus freundlicher Gastgeber. In der Küche erwartete uns ein Stadtplan, Informationsmaterial der Höhepunkte von Stockholm, u.a. ein Plan der verschiedenen Museen. Die Handhabung der technischen Geräte und alle anderen nützlichen Infos rund um die Wohnung hatte Espen uns schriftlich zur Verfügung gestellt. So gerüstet, haben wir drei Freundinnen unseren Aufenthalt in Stockholm in vollen Zügen genossen. Espens Wohnung können wir allen interessierten Stockholmbesuchern empfehlen."

The apartment met all our expectations. Everything was exactly like the photos, nice, clean and stylish. The SONOS audio system worked like a charm. The location of the apartment is perfect. It’s less than 15 minutes’ walk from Central station and most of tourists attractions are within a walking distance. We didn't have to use public transport at all. We can recommend this apartment for anybody travelling to Stockholm."

Vi skulle absolut boka lägenheten igen!

"4788",4046666,41720842,2015-08-09,3863045,"Russell","Espen's place was probably one of my favourite Airbnb's I've been in. My partner and I absolutely loved the flat, which is very stylish, with all sorts of cool touches, and in a great central location. We loved the wood floors, artwork, carbonated water tap and views out into the neighbouring park. The beds are comfortable and there's plenty of space to relax. 

Espen was very accommodating for when we arrived late, he showed us around and settled us in. He helpfully booked a taxi before our arrival which made getting from the airport to his place simple.

I can't recommend his home enough and I'd love to go back."

The room is large, with a comfy bed and desk. And the room as well as the entrie flat are perfectly clean. The place is close to Medborgarplatsen, and thus, also an easy stroll to, e.g., Gamla stan. An ICA open 7-23:45 is right around the corner. Altogehter: I really enjoyed my (short) stay!"

The flat is in a lively area, so if you search for peace and quiet it may not be right. It's 2 minutes from the underground station and easy to reach from the airport. The room is spacious, clean, with a comfortable bed."

Dick is supper nice, such a great guy to stay with. I will say there are some street sounds late at night on the weekend but nothing a pair of earplugs can't cure and as to be expected given that you are less than a block from the core of SoFo. The kitchen is perfect and Dick was super kind in helping me navigate the cupboards to find everything! Can't say enough - it's a gear space at a great price in a prime location!!"

"4811",4102677,45117697,2015-08-31,4818509,"Riley","Dick was a fantastic host. He was there to greet me when I arrived and showed me all the important bits of the apartment (shower, toilet, kitchen, etc.) He also is a big football fan, as am I, and happened to have an extra ticket to the Hammarby (the local team) match, which I gratefully accepted. I had a great time at the game with Dick and his son, Issac.

The apartment is conveniently located in Södermalm, just a few minutes' walk to the Medborgarplatsen Tunnelbana station. It will take you only about 5 minutes to get to central Stockholm. I would say the room is actually nicer than the pictures make it look. It's clean and very, very spacious. It is located on the corner of a fairly busy street, so what the other reviews have said about noise is generally true. It can be a bit loud on the weekends, but I'm a pretty heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me. But if noise is a concern, you may want earplugs just in case. But Dick's room is a great place to stay in Stockholm and I would definitely stay here again if I ever return."

The host recommended my way from airport and even check the train schedules for my way back. 
I highly recommend this room for its perfect location (easy way to all touristic area as well as right in the Center of a trendy area) the host welcome and the cleaness of everything.

I would highly recommend Ylva's home to families with kids. Ylva had everything from baby chair to baby cot to changing mattress to toys. The location of this apartment is another bonus. We walked everywhere and lots of shops and restaurants around this location that made it very convenient for us.
Even though I've not met Ylva, I feel he is a cool and a friendly person. He replied to every inquiry I had in timely manner and was helpful with his answers. Again, I would highly recommend Ylva's home! Will definitely return to Stockholm and to Ylva's home :)"

Eventhough we made the reservation on a very tight schedule (only a few nights before hand) we felt like Oscar was prepared. He responsseista immediately to all my questions.

The apartment was a short metro trip from down town and easily accessible. Oscar gave us precise instructions on how to find the place and was very flexible with exchanging keys and stuff (even offered to meet us at the airport). 

The apartment was perfect for two. Located high above the street level the street noise was locked out and substituted for a lot of daylight. The apartment was clean, airy and comfortable.

"4879",4224411,39370412,2015-07-23,1691865,"Jim","The location of the flat is extremely advantageous.  It is about a three minutes' walk from a metro station at the intersection of two lines.  That metro station is just below a large supermarket, with another large competitor supermarket a couple more minutes away.  And the flat is just up a low hill from the riverside promenade that leads, all waterside, right into the heart of Stockholm about twenty minutes' walk away - a very pretty route more enjoyable than the metro if time is available.
   The flat is well equipped.  It has a separate toilet/wash basin for the guest and a shared shower room.  The kitchen is fine.  The other public room is used by the host for her business, and not suitable for guest use.  There is a small outdoor patio available.
   The host was present on occasion for work on her business, but otherwise was off-site.
   The description was generally accurate, with one major reservation, about a promise of internet availability.  The listing assures access to an internet in addition to wi-fi.  I read the listing with that item checked off, and wrote individually for details to the host as a condition for booking there.  I was assured that I would have access to a computer.  When I came, I was offered a mini-I-pad, which the host herself was unable to use or advise in the use of.  Commands came up in Swedish, and the operation was entirely in Swedish.  If you are not a reader of Swedish, have you ever tried doing an email when the spell-check systematically alters every English word into the Swedish word that most resembles it visually?  The host should either contract out to get a easy switch for guests to use to put the machine into an English, or whatever other language, mode, or should cease to list access to a computer.
   Lastly, communications need improvement.  I wrote a request for information about procedures to use at the door of the building about five days before I got there; the reply came to me after I had arrived in Stockholm, too late to avoid a small problem at the door.

The apartment is exactly as shown on the picture, pretty small, but cosy. what's missing from the pic is that the bed is quite high ( 1.2m), and stuck in a corner (so not ideal for couples). The bathroom is also not the latest ( with a bath, and no shower/curtains). 
The neighborhood is great! Middle of sodermalm, lots of bars around, 2 subway stops from the old town / walking distance , 3 from the central station.

The apartment is in a very central location and we easily walked all over the city and were very close to some of the most popular neighborhoods and pedestrian streets.

The apartment was very comfortable and clean, though a bit tight for 3 people. The location was ideal for our sightseeing, and we felt very safe with the security entrance.  Kavian was super easy to work with, answered our numerous email enquiries promptly, and provided for all our needs.  Kitchen was well furnished. We'd recommend his place to anyone traveling to Sweden who want a very ideal location to the Old Town at a very reasonable price! Thanks, Kavian!!"

The location is one of the best you can find at a good price. It is within walking distance (500m) from the metro and 1.1km from T-Central. We walked for the three days to the Hay market and Gama Stan. There are a COOP supermarket and a 7-11 within 500m and at least a dozen eateries in the same radius. 

The apartment is neatly partioned and provides the needed space needed for everyday living. One of the bigger ones you can find in Stockholm City at this price. You can book the washing machine at the basement for free through Kavian. 

The host was super responsive and offers great advise instantly on eating and drinking spots even though he was not in town. 

The apartment could be a little noisy at night with the occasional loud car and a couple of drunken dudes but nothing alarmingly disturbing. 

Highly recommended!"

The apartment is very comfortable and it had everything we needed. The location was ideal - we were within walking distance of everything in Stockholm. It's on a very quiet street.  One of the things I detest when traveling - and it happens more often than one thinks - is flaky WiFi. I only look at Web sites and send email, and other AirBnb hosts I have stayed with had very undependable WiFi, but Kavian's network signal was very fast - I really appreciated that. Kavian's building has an elevator, which really came in handy!"

In summary, we had a memorable stay at the apartment, a very attentive host and a great experience for our first family trip to Stockholm."

She was away on vacation for most of my stay in her apartment, so as not to overcrowd the apartment, but when she was there it was always pleasant. I recommend her apartment, as it is located in a quiet more residential area- but also very near to everything in the center of the city. She also has a great list of recommended spots to enjoy in the city, so anyone staying at her place should read her 'guidebook.'"

I stayed in Johanna’s apartment for four months as a newcomer in Sweden. 
The bedroom I stayed in (facing the courtyard) is spacious and bodes an extremely large and comfortable bed. 
There was more than enough room in the closets to fit all my belongings (and I brought over 2 large and full suitcases). 
Johanna is a very warm and accommodating host and provided me with everything I needed and also shared her knowledge of the city; places to eat shop and see things. She’s active in the art world (I'm also interested in this) and invited me to see galleries and other events with her. Johanna is a warm person who generously offered her expertise and treats and even though she doesn't think so, she’s a great cook! :)"

It was clean, comfortable, warm, safe and the perfect size for two people. Jens was away for the two nights when me and a friend visited but he sent all the instructions we needed via email, which were very easy to follow. 

We loved the area (Hornstull), its well worth exploring if you have the time. We found lots of shops, cafes and bars we liked the look of (if only we had time for them all!) The metro station is a 5 mins walk away and its only a few stops from the centre of the city so its very convenient and easy to use (at the weekend the metro runs all night which is useful if you are coming back late and want to avoid taxis).

I would definitely stay at Jens place again and I can't wait to come back.

I have used dozens of other AirBnB flats in the past, and that never occurred before. Sadly, it wasn't only the sheets and towels. I had actually to bring my own blanket. 

In the flat there was only one really really thin cover, which wasn't enough through the night. I felt cold and didn't enjoy my sleep. 

On the positive side, the apartment is clean and quiet. 

To sum up, nice beautiful stylish apartment, with a great potential to offer a really good experience, if the owner could provide with the basic amenities.

Not to mention the amazingly talented and very welcoming family. It was a treasured Airbnb experience."

They answer Airbnb messages quite fast, and that was one of the best points. The apartment was located almost right next to Rådhuset station, which is only one stop away from T-Centralen. It was also possible to walk from Stockholm Central station to the apartment. Also, supermarket and Systembolaget was near the house, basically no need to worry about groceries and alcohol. The house was very cozy, and it was equipped with everything to live in the apartment, from milk to Chromecast. Overall, one of the best Airbnb experience for me."

It is immaculate, beautifully decorated, spacious and well located making it convenient to access sights and amenities (grocery, metro, restaurants). The owners did a fantastic job filling us in on the details of the apartment (which was well prepared with clean beds/empty closets) and also created an extensive list of sightseeing and restaurant recommendations. Honestly, our kids would've been happy just hanging out in the apartment all weekend. (For the record, we were able to do a bike tour with BikeSweden which was both fun and informative--all thanks to our guide David). We felt lucky to have found this gorgeous, quiet home on airbnb.

The apartment is perfectly located in the heart of Ostermalm which is a really nice area. The only bad thing (probably not depending on the host but on previous guests) is that it was generally dirty on the floor, the bathroom really dirty and the towels where used so we had to clean up the floors and the bathroom. In general I would say that considered the price it is good for students and young couples, maybe less for older people or families."

He was  a great host, quickly answering our questions and making sure we had everything we needed (including maps!) The apartment was spacious and comfortable. The big drawback was the party scene in / around this neighborhood. While there were no apparent bars on the street, every night we were there (even during the week but worse on the weekend) there were very loud drunk people outside the windows making a ton of noise. Definitely not Isaac's fault but something to be aware of if you're not a super deep sleeper."

It is less than 10 minutes to the metro and Gamla Stan is only 15 minutes walk away. Soderhalm is also very vibrant and there are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby yet the apartment is in a quiet street so not noisy - the Lebanese restaurant next door is popular but doesn't disturb late at night.

Its a lovely quiet street but a short walk away we found plenty of bars and restaurants for the evening and some amazing museums near by, especially the Photography Museum that we visited on Lotta's recommendation. 
Its also extremely easy to travel around to the other islands - we managed to walk to most, but the metro is very near the apartment and most places are a short ride away. 

Lotta was really flexible with times and quick respond, and left us with some great local tips - the ideal host!

Most of all, we we're really impressed with the fully stocked kitchen! We are keen chefs and like to make meals in the flats we stay in - Lotta's kitchen had absolutely everything we needed and more, which is a rare find!

Arianna was very helpful and gave us many tips about everything that was important for us (where to eat, how to get to many places, what is worth visiting). 
Public transport in Stockholm is perfect (but not chep). Arianna apartment is close to the subway so you can reach your destination points quickly and efficiently. 
The nearest shop is about 400 m away from the apartment and you can get there everything you need. Stockholm stores have a large variety of organic and vegan food.

We had such a positive vibe in this flat, and Henry and I really felt like we were in our own home.

We explored a lot the area and will definitely recommend the Urban Deli, either for brunch or to do grocery shopping. We had very nice drinks at a place called '' Habibi '' they also make oriental food, it was all great. If you fancy swedish meatballs go to NYTORGET, it is super good.

If we ever come back to London, we'd love to stay at Josefin's, we didn't even want to leave."

Josefin answered very quick on every email and organized everything with the keys perfectly, although she has been on holidays. 
The area in Södermalm is perfect: a supermaket
and a bus station in front of the house and little nice shops, bars, and cafes around! 
Thanks Josefin for letting us stay in your home!

"5210",4683232,29762185,2015-04-12,3762044,"Mirit","Josefin's flat is lovely! It resembles the photos a lot, it is super clean and cosy, and well maintained.
On our 2nd day we went to the LIDL supermarket (10 min walk away from the flat) and both some groceries and had a daily home-made dinner - a great option to stay on budget since the food is pretty pricey in Stockholm. The kitchen is equipped very well, making the cooking process easy and inviting.
We found zero faults in the apt but you should be aware to the softness of the mattress - which is really soft. Be sure that you and your backs won't have issues with that.

Location location location! Sodermalm is like the young bohemian neighbourhood of Stockholm which means a lot of great vintage stores, fun restaurants, great fika spots (the Swedish daily coffee & cake break), and tons of bars. Most of them close at 1 am the latest, with few exceptions which close at 3 am.

Josefin was very easy to communicate with, and she took care of everything while being out of the country.

Overall we loved the flat and we definitely recommend it!

It is right in front of the bus station but we didn't even feel the need to take the bus. It was a great 15 min walk to Slussen and Gamla Stan. The pharmacy, 7/11 and a supermarket is right down the corner which is very convenient. We haven't had a chance to meet Josefin in person, but she has thought of everything! With her directions, we could easliy find the apartment, and she was nice enough to leave a package with many items such as maps, tourist attractions, her suggested restaurants etc. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed (toilet paper, clean towels, trash bin, clean sheets). The apartment has a very nice energy with her lovely flowers. I would highly recommend her apartment!"

The place was nice and clean and full of all the amenities we needed to be comfortable! We absolutely loved all of the plants- they created a charming oasis to come home and relax in after long days of touring the city!

Gunilla gave me clear directions of how to get to her place and I didn't even need to ask twice. Everything is easy and clear. Also her place is very close to the subway station, and transportation is very convenient overall. Then the apartment is amazing, in terms of both design and comfort. Gunilla is a very thoughtful host and provided everything I could possibly need. She immediately made me feel like home and I settled down quickly and enjoyed great rest at her place. Though she doesn't drink coffee herself, she still has coffee ready for guests, which shows how considerate she is. Check-in & check-out was also super easy. Södermalm is a great place to stay at, with so much to see and do and the convenience to go anywhere basically. Stockholm is also a very walkable city and from Gunilla's place I have the option to do many things and go to many places simply by walking, or by taking public transportation. BTW right by the nearest subway station Mariatorget is probably the best coffee in Stockholm - Drop Coffee. So if you're a coffee nerd like me, you will be more than happy to stay here as well. Last but not least, I'm so happy that during my short stay, I was able to have a lovely chat with Gunilla. We talked about many things, sharing our traveling experiences and our views on Sweden and many other places. I think this is the best possible experience, to stay at a comfortable and tasteful place, and get to know your destination better through friendly and honest conversations with your local host. I recommend Gunilla's place to everyone who is looking for a great experience in Stockholm."

His apartment is centrally located within walking distance of all major attractions.  It was extremely clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend to anyone traveling to Stockholm."
"5327",4727760,32298054,2015-05-16,1261911,"Rana","Our stay at Marcus' place was honestly more than my boyfriend and I could have asked for! It is located in the hip Södermalm (think Brooklyn or Silverlake) area of Stockholm. It's a short 5 minute walk to the Slussen train which can get you anywhere you need to go. The apartment has every amenity we could have wanted, from a french press to Netflix. We even stayed in one night cooking and watching movies. The place itself is very clean and full of natural light. It is decorated very thoughtfully and cool - lets just say he gets it! The bed was really comfortable (something a traveler is always in need of) and is fitted with down pillows and comforter. Marcus was really helpful and checked in on us often. We will definitely look to stay here next time we are in Stockholm! Tack Marcus!"

Markus replied very quick and we stayed in one of the best appartments we ever had. The appartment is located in a zone with fanzy bars and restaurants close to Stockholms center. The appartment is absolutely clean, modern and all has everything you need. The underground is just 5 minutes away. Even if we  never met Markus personaly at this weekend, he was always helpful, gave us reccomendations for restaurants etc. It was no problem to let our luggage longer in the appartment (due to a late flight).
Great stay, would highlly recomend the appartment..."

It was such a pleasure staying in your BEAUTIFUL apartment, that was exactly as pictured, if not better. Lovely neighbourhood, close to trains that will get you anywhere, or else an easy walk most places. Lots of local cafes and shops to ease you into the neighbourhood. Perfect apartment for 2, bed was super comfortable, and w good size for two friends or a couple. Shower was awesome ! Marcus was all you could want in a host.

Checking in was easy as Marcus sent us clear instructions on how to get to the unit. We stayed at the unit for 5 days and had the best airbnb experience I've ever had. The unit itself is absolutely beautiful. The bed is so comfortable. You can go out to eat in the trendy suburb or have a home cooked meal in the kitchen. There's even Netflix to enjoy at night time. The unit is quiet and you'll get an amazing nights sleep and very centrally located, we walked everywhere! The wifi works perfectally. The unit is very clean and perfect for longs stays. Marcus always kept in touch with me and ensuring my stay was going well. I cannot wait to come back and stay again.  Thank you Marcus!!!"

"5359",4734944,26355878,2015-02-10,24014052,"Stefano","L'appartamento di Simon è esattamente come si vede nelle foto,  molto luminoso, con gli spazi ben distribuiti tra soggiorno/camera da letto, cucina e bagno. Poco più di 30 metri in tutto, ma ben organizzati. Simon è stato molto gentile e disponibile, ci ha accolti  personalmente ed è rimasto con noi il tempo necessario per farci conoscere meglio l'appartamento e le sue dotazioni.
Il quartiere sembra defilato rispetto al centro, ma è solo un'impressione: bastano poco più di cinque minuti a piedi per raggiungere la zona di SOFO, piena di negozi e locali, e qualche minuto ancora per il centro di Sodermalm. A circa 50 metri dal condominio ci sono le fermate della linea 2 del bus, che è semplicemente ottima: nelle ore di punta tra una corsa e l'altra ci sono pochi minuti, e la linea collega direttamente con il centro vero e proprio di Stoccolma, passando per Slussen e per Gamla Stan, lo splendido quartiere storico. Un'altra linea, la n. 53, ha la fermata a circa 200 metri. Con questa si raggiunge la stazione centrale in circa 10 minuti. La metropolitana si raggiunge in 10 minuti a piedi, oppure con tre fermate delle linee 2 e 53.
Un'altra grande comodità è il supermercato Coop, grande e ben fornito, che si trova a poche decine di metri. E' aperto ogni giorno fino alle 22, davvero utile per chi sceglie una soluzione del genere per prepararsi i pasti in casa.

She was a very welcoming and pleasant host and offered to give me a ride to Arlanda on my way out of town. The apartment is exceptionally comforting & clean and, echoing another reviewer, much larger than the pictures show.

The neighborhood is full of mostly families and students from nearby KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), very quiet, and has a number of good local cafes and restaurants I had the opportunity to try. The nearest metro station is four/five blocks away and has a direct route to the more tourist-y destinations in the city. If you want to feel like a local resident for a few days, this is a great place to book!"

There are lots of restaurants and little shops in the area and food store can be found just around the corner.

I saw a lot of parts of Stockholm and for me this was by far the best neighbourhood to stay in.  Safe, artsy, cool restaurants and cafes everywhere and great little shops.  If you like to bike ride I highly recommend renting a bike and exploring Stockholm that way.  There are so many paths to get to all parts of the city this way.  Lisa and Fred were on holidays but their friend Fredrick who was super helpful and lovely met me with the keys and offered any advice I needed.  Honestly I wish I lived in this apartment!"

"5383",4755973,30816840,2015-04-27,7351448,"Johanna","The apartment is in a great location for walking anywhere in Stockholm, near parks and stores. It is bright and nice and sparingly decorated in a Scandinavian style. 

The kitchen is small but ok, but there are precious few tools for cooking, only one pot, no bread knife, no sallad bowl, no mixing bowl, etc, just a few of the absics, but not all. There are four, old mismatched towels of varying size in the bathroom. The owner's belongings are in most cupboards and drawers, leaving little place for the renters' stuff. The owner's nail polish and candy is in the fridge together with old food. The kitchen cupboards are full of her stuff too, again leaving almost no place for the renters belongings.

When we arrived in the flat the TV did not work.The fridge had not been cleaned and there was old food and guck for us to clean out. The flat is very nice on on the surface but things like the kitchen fan, bathroom etc and not very well cleaned and really need a serious cleaning.

The bed is a a small queen and it is located in an alcove behind the kitchen. The one bed is squeezed in, from wall to wall. My husband who is 6 feet could not sleep there since he did not fit. I am 5,2 an also had issues with my feet continuously hitting the wall. 

The host is rude, unaccomodating and unhelpful and does not seem to understand what letting your flat thorough a service such as Airbnb entails. She seems to believe that she is doing us a favor, being nice just by 'letting us stay here', whereas the fact of the matter is we are paying her to rent her place and she has an obligation to make sure everything she has advertised works, that the flat is clean and functioning. Basically the concept of service does not seem to be part of her vocabulary. The concept of manners neither.  She seems to belive that she was more than nice and going out of her way even by attenpting to fix the TV, which never worked anyways. She once entered the flat with a second key while one of us was in the shower. She did not even understand why we got upset about that. Guests' privacy is clearly not of importance to her, nor does apologizing for just barging in or for things that are not clean or do not work seem a viable altenative for her, nor does making an appointment in good time if she needs to enter the apartment. Overall this was the strangest rental experience ever with a host that didn't have a clue as to how to professionally let a flat, it seemed it all revolved around her, what suited her, what she wanted and when. ."

It had 4 bedrooms that is very suitable for a family or 2. Our hosts, Cecilia and Anders took a lot of their own time to make us feel right at home. They left a write-up of all of their favorite places, most of which we sampled and were excellent. Cecilia and Anders also left a nice gift package for us. The location is great with many close dining and shopping options. The view is spectacular and it's very easy to get to the city centre despite the distance. I would definitely request to stay at Cecilia and Anders' place the next time I visit Stockholm."

Leiligheten var veldig ren og Cecilia og Anders hadde laget en fin beskrivelse av området med tips for oppholdet og de hadde også satt fram litt snacks og vin for å gjøre starten på oppholdet vårt perfekt. Beliggenheten er perfekt for de som vil bo i koselige og rolige omgivelser litt unna Stockholms travle områder. Veldig koselige kafeer, bakerier og spisesteder i nærheten. Vil absolutt anbefale Cecilia og Anders' hjem til folk som ønsker å få litt mer ut av sitt Stockholmopphold."

They welcomed us with chocolates, wine and a sweet note and were available to answer questions throughout our stay. Their home is truly magnificent-- spacious and airy, and so artistically designed and decorated. The Hammerby neighborhood is lovely and mellow-- perfect to stroll along the island, and a short ferry ride to the shops in Sodermalm. I highly recommend making use of the public transport and getting a 7-day pass if you're there for a week! My friends and I would love to return to Stockholm and stay here again in a heartbeat!"

The apartment has a very luxurious feel to it and a great living space that we very much enjoyed hanging out in. The area is outside of central Stockholm in a modern, quiet neighborhood. That said there were loads of lively places nearby to eat and drink. We took a couple of Cecilia and Ander's recommendations and had a great evening finishing in the brewery practically next door to the apartment. The transport nearby was OK - there are 3 boats an hour that take you to Sodermalm and an hourly boat that goes to Djurgarden and central Stockholm. We didn't find this a problem but it is probably worth checking the boat timetable so you can plan your day. Cecilia was very friendly and quick to reply to my messages. We also enjoyed our welcome gift :) Would not hesitate to recommend this apartment and would happily stay here again."

Their home is stylish yet functional, with bright sunlight and a wonderful kitchen. It is situated on a point of land that views the waterway, the ferry and their beautiful neighborhood. There is wonderful public transportation, grocery and bakery and bars nearby. We actually began using the ferry to access Sodermalm and the rest of Stockholm, walking our legs off joyfully. Our only regret is that we ran out of time to spend time in the restaurants and brewery right their on their lake \"strand.\" Oh, well, we'll just  come back and gladly stay again.  When you stay, don't miss an opportunity to climb the ski hill south of the apartment and look out over all of greater Stockholm."

We were a group a six adults (one couple and four friends) and this was perfect for us. It's very easy to get downtown - either with the charming ferry Emelie or taking the light-rail and subway - and one day we even walked back from Södermalm. There are also plenty of shops (we bought groceries and wine to use in the apt) and restaurants in the neighborhood. We had a very nice dinner at the restaurant Bistro Sjöstad only steps from the apartment - especially recommended if you enjoy Champagne. Cecilia was very helpful via messages (no other communication was needed), and there are also helpful instructions/tips in the apartment."

She was very prompt to respond to questions and concerns. The building had repairs during our stay which limited our ability to enjoy the outdoor space and Cecilia was wonderful in handling this! The space was very open and bright. There were 8 adults and we felt like we had enough room. The 2 bathrooms were a good size and the washer and dryer was a great addition.When we arrived, Ceciia left chocolates and wine and information on the flat and the area attractions. This was very helpful in planning our days. The apartment is well equipment. There are groceries close by and wonderful restaurants. We went to Jimmy's and Goteberg. We would recommend both! The bus line is a close walk and an easy transfer to the subway. We were downtown in 15-20 minutes. We would certainly use Cecilia's again."

We were welcomed with a bottle of wine, thank you for this one. We also liked the quiet and peaceful neighborhood, not far away from the city center, very easy to get there by public transport (boat or tram). For those who plan to combine their visit of the city with a concert at the Ericsson Globe, the apartment has the best location to go there. We also visited two of the restaurants (recommanded by Cecilia and Anders) nearby, Goteborg and Jimmy’s, we liked them both ( just in front of the main door, there was another restaurant that looked also very nice, Bistro, but was closed during our stay). The check-in and check-out were very also easy, as well the “key” system.
We simply liked everything about this amazing apartment, we’d like to stay there again when visiting Stockholm!

Of course I should have noticed, that cleaning and other stuff are not included, so it's only my fault..Though I believe, that I'm not the only one, who has misunderstood the renting conditions, so I just need to mention that.

Auch die Nachbarschaft ist schön, die Wohnung liegt wirklich praktisch für einen kurzen Städtetrip. Das Stadtzentrum erreicht man nach etwa 10 min per U-Bahn, zu vielen Bars, Restaurants und Geschäften in Södermalm kann man in ca. 10 min zu Fuß laufen. 

Douglas hat immer super schnell geantwortet und hat alles so vorbereitet, dass wir uns vor und auch während unseres Aufenthalts immer wohl gefühlt haben. Auch wenn wir ihn leider nicht persönlich treffen konnten, war er ein perfekter Gastgeber!
Wenn wir eines Tages nochmal nach Stockholm kommen  (...was wir ganz bestimmt tun werden), würden wir auf jeden Fall nochmal in dieser Wohnung übernachten.

Michael Tog sig god tid til at fortælle os om områdets muligheder, herunder gode spise steder og byområder med særlig søgning og miljø. Vi var to ægtepar på ferie sammen og lejligheden er vældig godt indrettet og ligger særdeles centralt i et spændende kvarter med masser af butikker, cafeer og spisesteder. Vi havde stor glæde af at der kun er få hundrede meter til nærmeste Metro station da vi ankom med toget.
Vi har nydt 4 dejlige dage i Stockholm, vi brugte megen tid på at udforske den smukke by. Har man lyst til flere oplevelser kan man jo som vi nemt tage færgen til Helsingki og få den dejlige oplevelse med turen igennem skærgården og Helsinki by med også.

Getting to the apartment from Arlanda was easy and Mikael met us promptly and showed us around the apartment; we had Mikael's number should we need him but everything worked well during our stay.  The apartment is on the first floor (there is a small lift) and has everything you need (two bedrooms, large lounge/diner, WiFi, well equiped kitchen and bathroom and a washing machine) and is well appointed, very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  For smokers there is an outside area with chairs and tables.  It is ideally situated in a great and safe area with supermarkets, bars, restaurants all within walking distance and the T-Bana (metro) just a few blocks away.

The furniture and beds are in very good condition, even we had a baby cot and a stroller available for us. Bathroom and kitchen were well supplied. Even though there is no lift, we could put our big stroller near the entrance.
The location is very good, not in crowded and noisy area, but very close to the city centre (10 minutes to the T-bana, 3 minutes and 6 minutes by T-bana to the Gamla Stan and T-Centralen respectively). A lot of restaurants and two supermarkets (ICA and Lidl) are within 5 minutes walk.

Vi opplevde at vi lå enda mer sentralt til enn vi hadde opplevelse av fra kartet. Det var enkelt å komme seg til og med t-banen. Vi fikk dermed gjort alt det vi hadde tenkt til rundt i byen samt tatt en tur i det hyggelige nabolaget. Samtidig hygget vi oss om kvelden i den særdels trivlige leiligheten. Det var litt utfordrende å få dusjet med deb håndholdte dusjen, men det at det var så utrolig gode senger veide lett opp for dette. Vi var tre voksne og et barn på ett år.  Hun storkoste seg og elsket at det var så mye gulvplass i leiligheten. Vi kunne også sove med åpent vindu på soverommene, da disse vendte inn mot en rolig bakgård. Dette er en perfekt leilighet om du reiser med et lite barn. Veldig god barneseng var det også samt en barnestol. Vi kunne låse inn barnevognen i et barnevognskur i første etasje og så var det bare en trapp opp til leiligheten. Alt virket rent og velholdt og det var et ekstra pluss at det var vaskemaskin!"

Anna was so sweet and helpful, answering all our questions. 
The flat is in perfect location -we love to walk and it takes about 15 mnts to the center,  otherwise bus and underground stations just around the corner 
The apartment was bright and warm, we had everything we possibly need considering we were with our 6 mounts old baby:))

She did everything to make our stay pleasant. Finally, a perfect place to stay in Stockholm.

Nous avons adoré notre séjour chez Anna. Anna est une personne très serviable, elle a toujours été disponible pour toutes nos questions pendant notre séjour (restos, machine à laver…). L’appartement est exactement comme sur les photos, très joli et cosy.  La salle de bains tient dans un mouchoir de poche, mais elle est très fonctionnelle.

"5539",4869908,26073870,2015-02-02,1106307,"Benjamin","Oscar var flexibel med inchecknings- och utcheckningstiderna och välkomnade oss i boendet trots att det blev sent en fredagskväll. Boendet var helt okej städat i allmänhet och stämde med beskrivningen. Han hade också uppgraderat möblerna mot vad man sett på bilder samt skaffat en bluetooth-högtalare så vi kunde spela musik trådlöst från våra telefoner utan problem – mysigt! Vi hann aldrig använda kakelugnen men den var fin att ha i periferin ändå.
Lägenheten ligger i ett gårdshus så vi hade en lugn och skön weekend i Oscars lägenhet utan störningar från gatan.

Tvärs över gatan ligger en matbutik (ICA) med bra utbud trots sin ringa storlek och det var bara en kort promenad till närmsta tunnelbanestation (Odenplan). 

Tyvärr var det lite orent på vissa ställen i lägenheten som gör att betyget dras ner något, t.ex. hår på golvet i duschen och dammigt/kladdigt på sängbordet, inte så roligt att behöva börja med att städa upp detta som gäst när man kommer. Värdens rakhyvel låg också framme på duschblandaren."

We recommend this little home for a small stay in Stockholm. Just don't forget to take a hair dryer and some shower gel. Otherwise it is a good place to live in few days."

The neighbourhood offers plenty of breakfast, lunch, fika and dinner options. You can walk everywhere but bus and metro are only down the street. Oscar is a great host and recommended some nice places and made as feel very welcome and at home."

- the neighbourhood is lovely, supermarket opposite the house, a good fish shop just to the left. 
cafes and bakeries nearby. really you won't miss anything.
Oscar  is a very friendly host and took care of us. There was only one blanket, but he brought a second one after we asked for it. 
It doesn't look as on the photos. there is different furniture, but all fine and nice, - the bed was good, we slept well. It's a backhouse, so no cars will disturb your sleep!
The apartment is not the cleanest place one could ask for, - but we asked Oscar for a vacuum cleaner and helped ourselves. - 
We liked to stay here and Oscar just started the renting out, so i am sure he will better some things, - and as i mentioned, he is very friendly and absolutely willing to take care and to be available and of help for his guests! Thank you, Oscar!"
"5543",4869908,27215147,2015-02-28,26988420,"Johannes","From the moment we walked through the door, we knew that our week in Stockholm will be a great success. Everything was just perfect. Oscar's apartment is absolutely stunning - a mix of modern design and Swedish charm. The place was very tidy, fully equipped with kitchen utensils and everything you could ask for. The description on the website matched our experience to 100%.  

The fireplace was a huge bonus, as it put the cherry on top of the cake after a long day walking through Stockholm in February.  

Regarding the location, no journey took us longer than 10-15 minutes on the bus or tube. The area is rather residential, though provides stunning views on the city from a nearby hill, gives an insight into the wide range of architecture in Stockholm and has a wide range of small restaurants, cafes and bars. The ICA supermarket as well as Hemkopp are just a few minutes away.

Oscar is a very friendly and experienced host, who wanted us to have the perfect stay. He met us in his flat and was very professional about the satisfaction levels during our stay. He was very flexible in terms of check-in and check-out times and always available on his phone in case of any questions. 

It goes without saying that we would definitely recommend his place to anybody who wants to have a stress-free and beautiful stay in Stockholm. Should we go back to Stockholm, Oscar's place would definitely be our first choice.

The apartment is located in a very nice area with many cafes, restaurants, supermarkets near by and well serviced by public transport. The kitchen, bedroom and bathroom were as shown however the lounge, dining and balcony had different furniture to that shown. Because the bed looked small in the photo we were planning to use the large sofa but there was a different sofa to the one shown and not so comfortable to sleep on. The dining table was different too, with only two chairs, which meant we could not invite anyone to dinner, a shame when we had such a beautiful kitchen full of good crockery and all the pots, pans and gadgets you could wish for. These things aside, we enjoyed our stay."

However, if you're looking for home away from home for a longer period of time and base your choice on interior design and furniture seen on the images, please notice that almost all furniture, carpets, art on the walls and houseplants will be different from current images (June 10th 2015). I guess there must be some reasonable explanation to this, but we were quite surprised to notice it. We don't want to be picky, but believe that other guests should be aware of this fact. At this price what you see should be at least quite near what you'll get."

- Barrio muy tranquilo
- Tiene la estación de Tren a unos 5min

Menos positivas:
- Se oye un poco el tren que pasa relativamente cerca del apartamento.
- El apartamento está ubicado en un tercer piso sin ascensor con escaleras algo empinadas. Nosotros llevábamos una maleta muy pesada al ser 2 adultos y 2 niños. Por tanto hay que hacer un esfuerzo a la llegada y a la salida.

Gracias Mikael por tu amabilidad"

We thank Mikael for offering us his cosy, clean, tidy and warm apartment. He was very helpful before and during our stay. He sent us alternative ways to arrive city center from Arlanda airport, a map to reach at the apartment from Gullmarsplan station, and even a pdf that tells us anything about the apartment - how to use the TV, heating system, microwave, even how to open the sofa bed. Besides, there's a printed version of this pdf, readily at the house. 
If you are planning to go to Stockholm, and if you are looking for a warm, organized, clean and central apartment with a kind, helpful host; I recommend you to stay here."
"5586",4940669,33105703,2015-05-25,1875105,"Sven","Katarinas flat was an awesome find for us in Stockholm!!! Unfortunately we couldn't meet in person, but everything was perfect when we arrived. The flat is spacious enough for a couple and a small child - like we were travelling. There is a big bed for two and a cot for a child in a seperate room. Also a big kitchen/dining room/living room combination. The flat was nicely decorated and we felt right at home from the beginning!! 

The flat is in the Kungsholmen-area of Stockholm. A little bit off the beaten touristic path. But no problem at all. The bus stop is right around the corner and the metro-station (blue and green line) just four minutes away. Walking into the city center might take you about 25-30 minutes. So no problem either. The flat is located in a small and quite side-street. We felt safe and comfortable at all times.

Kungsholmen itself is quite charming and we like the feeling of a real \"neigborhood of Stockholm\" outside of the touristy parts. You'll find Shopping, Drinking and Dining in abundance withing easy walking distance. And the best thing: a big park and the shore of the Mälar is just some five walking minutes away. another plus: The coaches from the airport stop right around the corner! And the house has an elevator!

We can only remonend Katarinas flat to any Stockholm traveller and would gladly stay there again on another trip to one of the most beautiful cities in Europe!"

The appartment has all the facilities you want and it was in perfect state and very clean. But on top of that, Katarina (our host), was extremely caring. We've received a very nice welcome message, with some nice inside tips about Stockholm and we felt very welcome.

This was our first AirBnB experience and this was a good one!

The apt was very clean and so cosy and comfortable :). We always came back to take a break from sightseeing, relaxed and ate there.  There is enough space for three persons. The location is perfect for exploring the city, because a lot of busses and tunnelbana (metro) are only one minute, or less, away. The area is clean and silent. A lot of restaurants, bars, supermarkets and even a shopping mall are very close and easy to reach on foot. As well as a huge green area and the water which is very beautiful. During a short walk to the city center (only 10' - 15' approx) you can see a lot of interesting ancient ships from a national ship association and there you directly come to the stadshuset, which is also lovely. Also by public transport, which is reliable and comes often and frequently, you get everywhere for sightseeing very fast and easy!
Katarina and her family are so lovely people, we are happy to got to know them! :)
We are convenient and happy in every way and can highly recommend this apartment and it's owners to spend time in Stockholm."

The place is awesome and just as the pictures suggest, it is really beautifully styled and feels like you are staying in a magazine. Timo is an excellent host, he met me at the station, drove me to the apartment, helped with my luggage and then took me on a walk around the neighbourhood so I could get familiar with the area. He also left a phone that we could use while in Stockholm. The apartment location is excellent, and is around the corner from SOFO, and other cool paces with great restaurants and bars. It is also close to Slussen station, where you can catch a train pretty much anywhere you need to go. Super convenient. Around the corner is one of Stockholm's best coffee shops Johan and Nystrom, (Website hidden by Airbnb) and I recommend you try \"meatballs for the people\" (which was closed while we were there, but we went to the owners other restaurant and the meatballs were fantastic!!!). All in all a great stay. The lift was being fixed while we were there, but we didn't mind the walk up the stairs to level 5. A good little bit of extra exercise to work off those meatballs!"

If not, go for it. It's an excellent place to stay and Timo is a great host.

The apartment is in an amazing location within easy walking distance to lots of sights and trendy restaurants / bars. 
Pär kept in touch before we arrived and responded promptly to my messages, I asked if there was an iron we could use and be even left the iron and the board out ready for us!

Tip for others: Joakim offered to meet me at the station but I declined as it is very easy to find on your own. I took the commuter train from Arlanda to Sodrä Stockholm, which is less than a 10 minute walk away from his place. Very easy - no transfers and costs signficantly less than the express / subway."

You're a block away from the Mariotorget T-bana (metro) stop. In 3 stops, 10-15 minutes, you're at Stockholm Central Station, the main train and bus terminal in Stockholm (the city's public transportation is first-rate). The island/district Södermalm is filled with cool bars and restaurants, and is preferable to the touristy areas of Normaalm or Gamla Stan, for example. Joakim was a great host. Very friendly and welcoming, he was helpful with logistics ahead of arrival and extremely accommodating during the stay. The listing is fully accurate. The room is on the smaller side, but is plenty sufficient, has a nice view, and the bed is comfortable. The shower is shared, but there's a separate bathroom without a shower for yourself. The rest of the apartment is warm, clean, and cozy. If I'm ever in Stockholm again, I'd hope to stay here."

The room itself was nice, clean, and comfortable. The big windows let in lots of natural light, but can be a bit bright at nighttime since the curtains are not fully opaque, so bring blinders.

Getting there was no problem. Joakim was always really quick to answer so we could immediately access the flat after getting to Stockholm. He also had some tips regarding what to do. I would definitely recommend staying with Joakim."

And the neighborhood was also really cool, lots of bars and cafes just around the corner. Joakim was also really cordial and  nice to talk to."
"5705",5052863,43036553,2015-08-17,5221589,"J. Todd","Joakim's apartment is located in a beautiful neighborhood with easy access to the Metro and to some of the most scenic walks in Stockholm. From the apartment, I was able to easily meet friends, explore Stockholm, and enjoy my brief stay comfortably.

Joakim gave clear instructions for getting to the apartment from Stockholm Central, and was awaiting my arrival. He was warm and friendly and had prepared a room and private toilet that was perfect for my needs. As a traveler, I sometimes need \"downtime\" and get burned out on sightseeing too much, so I also appreciated that the room was quiet and comfortable in those times when I needed to take a nap or read or just recharge my batteries before heading back out into the city.

The only downside for me was not having access to the kitchen, as sometimes it's nice (and cheaper) to be able to just eat at home. My stay was short by necessity this time, so this did not affect my overall rating of Joakim or his apartment; but if you're a traveler who prefers cooking at home, be aware of this. 

If you need a centrally located, comfortable, warm and inviting space in Stockholm, Joakim is the host for you."

It's central enough to walk into town and the T-bana is right there on your doorstep. The room is comfortable and the bed is great; you'll get a good night's sleep. Joakim and I didn't cross paths often during my short stay (I spent most of my time exploring) however he was warm and welcoming as a host and very helpful with the few questions I had."

The reason I chose the specific listing is that it was located right next to everywhere I had to be during these days, and the price was just right.  However, when I arrived I realized that it was more than a convenient location.

The room was exactly as depicted in the photos.  Clean, well lit and with a great view.  

Joakim was very discreet during the few times that we were together in the apartment, in a way that sometimes I did not even know he was there.  He was very helpful and thorough on whatever I needed during my stay.  The complimentary tea or coffee in the room was also a welcome treat upon my arrival.

He was easy to reach. We communicated via messages on AirBnB. He was prompt with his replies. He welcomed us with a bottle of wine, which was a very nice surprise. We took a van from Taxi 020 from ARN airport and was charged SEK735 for 5 people. We were told if it was 4 then it would be SEK470 ( fixed rate to Stockholm city) The metro station was about 5 mins walk away and there's a Coop convenient store nearby. Opposite the station is a mini golf place and a Thai food stall. One of the best Thai food, better than some restaurants in Thailand. 7 stations away (about 20mins) from the T-Centralen ( Stockholm C-main station where you can take the trains to other parts of Sweden and I believe the bus station is also there)

It is in a great location, with various places for breakfast or coffee close by but also very close to a subway station meaning transport to other areas was very easy. 
Oskar's communication was just right, checking everything was going ok without being overbearing and his advice on transportation to the apartment (the flygbuss from Arlanda, stops just down the road in case you were wondering!) was spot on!
All in all an awesome stay!"

A few things could have been communicated more clearly in advance. We knew that there is a cat but we weren't told that we would have to feed it and let it into and out of the yard (two floors down) several times a day. It isn't allowed outside at night so it kept jumping on our bed and keeping us awake. Also, the name of the place where we were told to pick up our key apparently changed some time ago, so that led to some confusion and walking around the neighborhood which could have been easily avoided.
Nevertheless, thank you Corinna for your hospitality!"

The bed is comfortable (i was a single traveller), the living space is good and spacious (as seen in the photographs).  The kitchen is small but convenient (again, as seen in the photographs). The bathroom is spacious too. Overall, good apartment.
Even though i had issues with the wi-fi, Kjell fixed it the next day :)
There is no iron/board, however, i was able to manage, hence was not a big issue. 
The laundry is located in the underground and Kjell made a reservation at a short notice (special thanks for that).
Overall, it was a very good stay and i would recommend Kjell and his place, if the description and location suits anyone's needs.
Thank you Kjell!
Have a good day!"

Tapasimme asunnolla ja Kjell neuvoi meille kartan avulla lähialueelta kaupat, hyvät ravintolat sekä kulkuyhteydet eri puolille Tukholmaa. Kjell oli sekä ennen majoitusta, majoituksen aikana että vielä sen jälkeenkin hyvin tavoitettavissa ja vastasi viesteihin nopeasti.

Asunto vastasi kuvausta ja oli juuri sitä, mitä etsimmekin. Saimme leikkiä oikeita tukholmalaisia viikonlopun verran. Asunto oli siisti ja kaikki toimi hyvin. Näkymä parvekkeelta oli viehättävä ja parvekkeella oli mukava nauttia aurinkoisesta Södermalmista.

Alue on viihtyisä ja palvelut hyvät: kioski ja kauppa ja pari ravintolaa samassa korttelissa. Helppo kulkea."

The appartment is very comfortable; it has all you need.  It is also very quiet and clean.  We had good weather and enjoyed sitting on the terrace.  The busstop in front of the house is very practical; on weekdays you never have to wait more than a few minutes on a bus, and bus 76 takes you right into the touristic zone.  The subway is about 10' walking.  The neighbourhood is very relaxing; the waterfront is not far off and there are also a few viewpoints and parks nearby.  A little supermarket is around the corner. In other words: we loved it and would advice it to everyone."

He took extra time to meet with me upon my arrival, circling specific spots on a map & explaining directions to places which were of specific interest to me.  He even went the extra mile, helping me with other needs during my stay.

Kjell's home was set in the ideal location for my stay in Stockholm.  Within walking distance were three parks, several restaurants, coffee shops, and the lovely Canal.  There was a bus stop directly in front of the apartment that made accessing most of Stockholm a breeze.  The apartment itself was equipped with all necessary to prepare a nice meal.  It also allowed beautiful views via the balcony.  In the apartment, there was also a large TV, wifi, & laundry facilities (reservation required).

She left a note with all directions and recommendations. And she was guiding me all the time: by answering different questions, giving directions where to go, how to find, etc.

Micaela's apartment is a big, nice and cosy one. It is located near the center (about 20 minutes on feet for me), but saying that I should mentioned that still the neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet. 

Micaela prepared all the needed things for living (towels, etc.) and invited to feel at her home like at home. It was very nice to hear that. She even suggested to use her coffee, tea, etc.

If I would rerun to Stockholm, I definitely would choose Micaela's home and her as a host.

Although we did not meet Maya, as she was out of the country with work, she provided us with excellent instructions on how to find her flat, and we were met there by her boyfriend who was a great guy. He gave us a map of the city and suggested a number of restaurants, shops and cafe's in Stockholm. 
Maya also left us a welcome basket full with breakfast goodies, freshly ground coffee and a large Easter egg. 
Shower gel, shampoo and toothpaste were also provided which was a great help.
The flat is in a lovely suburban area of Stockholm with nature very close by, (one day we saw a baby deer and got super close to it) but still only a quick 10 minute tube journey through to city.

Wonderful stay and would definitely stay at Maya's flat again !

L'appartement était très propre et bien préparé à notre venue avec des serviettes de bain, du dentifrice, du savon, accès wi-fi et même des produits frais dans le frigo et des fruits pour le petit-déjeuner! Nous n'avons malheureusement pas eu l'occasion de rencontrer Maya, mais elle nous a donné beaucoup d'informations avant notre arrivée.

The appartment itself is very spacious including a high ceiling to accentuate the space. Next to that the interior was a mixture of playful stuff like a wall of instruments and good equipment like inbuild bluetooth speakers which you can connect to your devices. We could make use of all the attributes in the kitchen that where all of good quality, so this was ideal for cooking some home cooked meals which if you want to avoid the Stockholm dining prices is not a bad idea. Location is often one of the most important aspects of an appartment because you tend to be mainly on the road as a traveller. The house is in the middle of Sodermalm which was our favourite part of Stockholm. Some good (Fika) bars  are at 2 mins walk. There is a COOP and Hemkopp at walking distance and its a 5 min walk to Gotgatan which offers loaths of shopping/fika/eating opportunities. Gamla Stan is also at walking distance, but if you prefer otherwise you can always take the subway as there is a station at 2 min walk as well. After Stockholm we went camping in the Archipelago for a couple of days and leaving some of our suitcases for the time being was no problem at all. This we thought was a nice gesture by Eric and Michaela. All in all we would certainly recommend the appartment to anybody."

We met him at the beginning and he told us a bit about the city and he also has heaps of brochures and maps in the apartment which were really helpful for planning our days. The room was clean and comfortable with very little noise. The apartment is also in a great location, right near a train station and not too far to walk to the old town either (it took us about 15 minutes or so). Overall a perfect experience in Stockholm!"

"5958",5318211,39229557,2015-07-21,21761870,"Robert","I would recommend this room for the backpacker crowd.  For a family of three, it was very cramped.  The location is great (kitty-corner from a train station), with some good restaurants in the neighborhood.  Unfortunately, Marcus had to be out of town during our visit, so we didn't meet him personally.  However, he did provide quick answers to all my questions by e-mail.  Bottom line:  This is an economical stay for one or two people, but too small for three."

Maps were left for us to use which was very helpful.  It was very close to both train and metro stops.  We never met our host though did have email access and phone number.  The room was very clean and nice. Quite pleasant.   It was very very small.  For the two nights we were there it was just what we needed.  If it would have been for a longer visit and if we needed more down time in the room it would have been too small.  A good experience overall!"

Location is perfect, near city centre and communication with the host before check-in was very easy. In the apt there are other rooms for rent and we found the two shared bathrooms clean enough. Markus told us before arrival that we should have prepared the bed by ourselves: we found the room as the prevuious guests left it, with garbage in the trashcan and wet towels on the bed. That was not the best thing, but for us was ok."

I really loved the view from the window, as it looks into a backyard of a bunch of apartments and the fall colors were very pretty. Marcus also helped us with some restaurant tips when we first arrived. The apartment is in a great neighborhood, kinda trendy. There are two subway lines very close, one basically right across the street. There were also two bathrooms, which was cool. They were clean...but I think could have been a bit cleaner...but it wasn't bad. Also, there was a kitchen, fully equipped. We didn't use it...but should have and I suggest others do the same...Stockholm is SUPER EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!!! But in general, a nice place to stay, in a great location!"

Asa is incredibly kind, her home is clean and wonderfully decorated and warm and cozy which was a relief since it was a bit chilly during our visit.  Asa recommended a fantastic neighborhood Turkish restaurant and we are still thankful as the food was delish.  Her beautiful cat Trizzy is probably the sweetest cat on this planet so if you like cats you will adore her!  If you have the opportunity definitely stay with Asa, we are so glad we did =)"

Nous avons passé deux semaines merveilleuses entourées de calme et de beauté entre la mer baltique, la forêt et ses animaux et quelques oeuvres d'art au mur.
Henrik and his wife warmly welcomed us and have shown themselves helpful in every moment. The apartment, away from downtown, is very well served by public transport that put us 20 minutes from downtown Stockholm. On foot, there is a small supermarket nearby, the forest, a beach, the botanical garden, the Museum of Natural History. The apartment is large, comfortable and well equipped.

The house has 4 levels but we mostly utilized the 2nd level where the kitchen and living room is and the 3 rd level is where the bedrooms are. My children are a bit too young to stay at the attic and basement. It is well appointed for children Lina left plenty of toys out for my kids to get busy. It has a very modern appliances, I love the kitchen it is bright and roomy. 
The location of the house is less than 10 minutes walk to the metro station, shops and restaurant. They have a very quiet neighborhood, small play park for the kids nearby. 
Lina is very helpful with information and always available on the phone whenever needed. Their next door neighbor was lovely people and very helpful too. 
Although the metro is overhead, you can't really hear it if all the windows are closed. 
I would highly recommend Lina's house to families who wants to stay in Stockholm.

WE would definitely stay there again!

The place is in a great location for what we were looking for- a nice neighborhood close to the city center but not in it. The area around the Kartorp Metro station is very green. There are biking trails and hiking trails all very close to the house. The walk to the metro was just 10 minutes and then 10-15 minutes by train to the city center. 

The house was very nice with a great kitchen and living area on
the main floor, a bedroom with a double bed and another with a single bed on the 2nd floor and a loft with a single bed as well. Downstairs from the main floor was another room with a sofa bed and if needed a cot. We had six adults and 5 of us found the beds very comfortable. The 6th person who slept on the cot did not feel it was very comfortable."

Highly recommended for families. Lots of space, garden to run around in, children's toys. (Very small children could find it tricky with stairs to attic and basement).

Huset är mycket gott skick och välvårdat som ett trähus kräver av sin ägare.

Lina kom också förbi och hälsade och vi är väldigt glada att vi fick ta del av Familjen Holmgrens fina hus.

Kommunikation är enkel med en liten promenad på ca 400 m till Kärrtorps Tunnelbana som tar lite drygt 15 min till city avgångar var 7 min.

Allerdings ist diese Wohnung sehr klein und bietet für einen längeren Aufenthalt kaum Komfort. Die Dusche ist winzig und für kräftigere Menschen kaum zu benutzen. Nach einer Dusche ist das gesamte Mini-Bad total nass. Es gibt keinen Kleiderschrank, um Kleidung aufzuhängen. Ein Fernseher fehlt ebenso wie Wifi. Gelegenheit zum Waschen/Trocknen gibt es nur im Keller, wenn eine Maschine frei ist. Leider funktionierte die Heizung nicht, obwohl es Außentemperaturen von nur 10-18 Grad gab. Deshalb habe ich gefroren und fühlte mich nicht wirklich gemütlich. Das Apartment liegt ideal, ganz in der Nähe von Mariatorget (U-Bahn) und Slussen (U-Bahn, Bus, Boot). Es eignet sich perfekt, um die Stadt zu erkunden, denn die Weg sind kurz. Allerdings ist es eher für Studenten/Rucksacktouristen geeignet als für Menschen, die einen minimalen Komfort wünschen. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt in dieser Wohnung nicht. Der Preis von 89 Euro/Tag ist zu hoch (trotz guter Lage), dafür bekommt man in Stockholm auch Hotelzimmer und hat mehr Komfort."

There was a small misunderstanding before I arrived and so the place wasn't quite ready for me with new sheets and towels, but Fabian sorted it all out for me the same day within only a few hours. The bed was very uncomfortable for me, as it was very soft and slouching. Not very good support. The place wasn't quite as clean as I would like, but was still very nice overall. Definitely a good experience! Thanks Fabian!"

Efficient response from the host from day one up until out last day in Stockholm.
Location was perfect for the offered price - about 10-15 min from the lively city centre. Although this area had enough (coffee places, shops, restaurants) to be a sufficient place on it's own.
Our thanks to host Fabian for the lovely stay in Stockholm.
We certainly would recommend this place to anyone who's interested.

Yes, you might hear some bottles being recycled, but unless you are super sensitive, nothing to write home about! A great stay."

Neighborhood is more residential/on the quieter side, but it was easy to walk/metro to other interesting areas like Södermalm and Östermalm.  One thing was that since the flat is on the first floor and the curtains were not transparent, there was not much lighting without sacrificing privacy.  In any case, Fabian was easy to get in contact with and very helpful with arrival/departure questions!"

His studio is as described and is perfect for two people wishing to stay in the city. It has everything you need and results in a very comfortable stay. It is located around a 20 minute walk from all the main attractions in the centre of the city. The metro is also a 1 min walk away which allows an even quicker access to the city centre.

The apartment is well located  with many bars and restaurants nearby; it's very modern and is OK for two persons. We couldn't find any trash cans in the apartment, any soap to clean the dishes, nor any hand soap for ourselves. The apartment is close to the street, so it can get quite noisy. Fabian was great and very flexible when it came to check-in and check-out times. The water from the shower did tend to get out a bit, which made it kind of uncomfortable sometimes.

It is close to the city center, hence, close to most of the offices. It is also close to most of the tourist locations. The supermarket and train station are less than 5 minutes walking distance. The apartment is also large enough to fulfil all basic needs and all the facilities are easy to use, just as described. The building is clean and quiet. 
I could not meet Fabian, even though he tried to meet me. He had to visit his family outside Stockholm for Christmas. But he kept in touch with me everyday, through phone and email, to make me feel comfortable. I recommend this place for a satisfying stay in Stockholm.

"6186",5455946,34715020,2015-06-11,121530,"Elizabeth","Martina waited at the flat to hand over the keys and suggested some of her favorite eating places.  The flat looks just as seen in the pictures.  It is one of many flats in a beautiful old high rise along the Soder Malarstrand. It is very convenient to public transportation, including the Flyggbussarna that takes you to and from Arlanda (Website hidden by Airbnb) best thing about the location is its easy access for walkers  and photographers to both Monteliusvagen and Fjallgatan, that affords lovely views of Ridarholm, Gamla Stan, Lake Malaren, and Stockholm.  The flat is clean and cozy, though the very space-efficient Stockholm bathroom needs some getting used to."

Her apartment is beautiful and well-equipped with everything you need for a couple of days. The location is also great - you can reach the centre of Södermalm within a 10min walk and in the area around the apartment are also many nice cafés and restaurants to spend some time at. Martina herself is a great host, always making sure you feel comfortable at her place and giving helpful advices on what to see and where to go in Stockholm. All in all we definitely recommend to stay at her place!"

She gave us some useful informations on what is worth visiting in the city, and she even provided us a map. We could get in touch with her any time we needed, even before travelling to Stockholm. The apartment was neat and tidy, just the same as on the pictures, though the bed was a little bit narrow for two people. The flat is situated in a beautiful and peaceful environment with a good location, close to subway and bus station as well. We really enjoyed staying at Martina's place. It is highly recommended to stay there; if we ever decide to return to Stockholm, we will definitely choose her apartment again."

Perfect location (close to everything and wonderful view in the street next door), very cute and cosy place, you feel home very quickly, price (pretty cheap for a place on söder), quiet.

What (in my opinion) need more attention : 
Bed a little bit too narrow for 2 adults, Some stuff missing in the kitchen (proper stove, proper salt, toaster),..., bathroom too small and not very convenient, leaking bathroom sink...

Finally, Martina was very nice and available too. Ready to help us at anytime. I do recommend this place for short trips in stockholm :-)"

It included a balkony that had sunlight in the morning, which gave a good start to every day.

Vanessa was quick to answer all of our queries and was very helpful throughout our stay. We especially appreciated Vanessa's flexibility on check-in time due to our delayed flights!
The apartment is easy to find and very well situated in the heart of the trendy SOFO district. There are many lovely bars and restaurants in the immediate area and a very good grocery store about 10 mins walk away. The apartment itself is BEAUTIFUL. The pictures don't really do it justice.

There's a nice 1,5x folding bed and a retractable sofa, so there's theoretically room for 4 people. The kitchenette is perfectly adequate, there's a dishwasher, although I could not find a washing machine. Linen, towels and everything like that was waiting ready when I arrived. Wifi worked perfectly.

My flight was late, but Oscar waited for me without any complaints. We understood each other perfectly and were done with the introduction in 5 minutes. I threw the keys in the mailbox when I left. As this was a business trip, that was exactly what I needed. Oscar is a superb host, and I'm sure we would have found plenty of things to talk about if I had more time.

Assistance never felt far away though we at the same time felt that we had the privacy we needed. Both Kerstin and her husband are very welcoming people and the room was clean and spacious.

She seemed to be really excited about sharing her city with us! The description was accurate, but almost understated! This flat/2br apartment is REALLY nice!!! We (my wife and child, and in laws) loved every second of being there. It was in a great location, 2 blocks from the subway/tube, 3 blocks from a supermarket, and a block from a GREAT Thai place. We walked most of the time, and it was perfect for walking too."

She was responsive and sent all the information we needed to safely arrive at the apartment where she was waiting for us to show us around and give us the keys. Throughout our whole stay, if we had any question, we could call Mia and she responded right away. Always very nice and helpful. 

The apartment was even nicer that what you could see in the pictures. It had a lot of light and wonderful furniture. We are a family of 4. With 2 kids ages 10 and 12. The neighborhood was incredible and perfect for our family. One block away from the subway that can take you anywhere you want to go, a lot of bus lines, a park that we enjoyed multiple afternoons, with a playground and skate park and a street soccer court. Also, just 10 minutes walk in the park took us to a wonderful place where we could have a delicious lunch next to the water. It was fantastic and no doubt we will ask Mia to share her apartment again with us next time we go to Stockholm."

Mia's apartment is located in one of the nicest neighbourhoods of Stockholm - very close to the water and parks; at the same time 3-4 mins walk away from the metro ( T Bana) stop which will take you to the city centre in less than 10 mins.

The apartment was very spacious , more than what you actually can visualize from the pics. The 2 bedrooms were airy, large with comfortable beds. The living room was big with all electronic gadgets that you need at hand. She was so helpful as to leave her Macbook for us , which we didn't need. The refrigerator was stocked with food for us.

We had a very comfortable stay and would definitely recommend staying at her place."

Es war sehr ruhig im Haus und der Umgebung. Es war durchgehend leicht geheizt, so dass wir nicht frieren mussten (teilweise hatte es nur 10 Grad draussen). 
Roger war ein sehr freundlicher Gastgeber, der alles mögliche getan hat, damit wir uns wohlfühlen. Er hat uns persönlich empfangen, um den Schlüssel zu übergeben und unsere Fragen zu beantworten. Im Schlafzimmer hatte uns genug Platz frei geräumt für unsere Sachen Den fehlenden Fön hat er uns am nächsten Tag zusammen mit einem Radio, das er speziell für uns gekauft hat, vorbeigebracht. Die ganze Woche über war er für uns telefonisch erreichbar.

Apartment is also very clean and well furnished. 3 min away you also have 7-11 for grocery shopping and a good burger place for late night food.

Roger was a great host: very responsive online pre-arrival, received me personally and gave me hints on what to do both on day and night activities! He also lent me a rechargeable metro card, which was super useful to get everywhere.

The apartment is confortable, clean and nicely decorated, with a kitchen full of light, a living-room with a balcony from which you can watch the boats passing and a very silent sleeping room. Roger was here to welcome us even though we arrived very late in the night, and he took the time to show us a great bar in the neighbourhood. We realised during the WE that this area of Stockholm is full of such great places to go out at any time of the day, for breakfast, brunch, lunch, fika, diner, drinks … and the tube is a 5 min walk away to take you anywhere else in the city. Should I move to Stockholm, this is where I would like to find my home!"

The property is on the lake. Cozy, clean and lovely. But the truly fantastic add on is the hospitality. Maria and her family took care of all my needs from kayaking (including life jacket et. al), breakfast based on what I like and directions to what to see and where to go.
I enjoy spending time on my own on holidays and this place, even though on their property, allowed me that privacy whilst at the same time they were always there should I need help.
It is slightly outside of the city centre which can seem daunting. I was there for a work conference and stayed for the weekend. You have to take a short bus ride but (and I am notorious at being bad with directions) after the first journey I was a pro. Plus there is the lovely restaurant next door.
If you want a relaxing holiday, with a wonderful lake front view, all the adventure amenities, close trip to city centre and superb hospitality from the friendly hosts, then this IS THE place to stay in Sweden. 
Looking forward to going again!"

Maria und Per sind sehr herzliche Menschen und waren immer sehr bemüht um unser Wohlergehen. 

Die Unterkunft entsprach genau unseren Vorstellungen.
Idyllisches Häuschen direkt am See. Das Frühstück war sehr lecker und wir konnten auch unsere Wünsche dazu äußern. 

Kurzum: Ein Aufenthalt hier ist ein MUSS! :-)

The place is idyllic with beautiful nature around. It's excellent to combine both city trip and relaxing. You have excellent connections to public transport and can get easy to the city center. Besides the house is a public beach, a restaurant and a beachvolley field, a track to go for a walk around the lake... 

Maria and her family were very opened and helpful. The breakfast in the morning  taken outside was prepared with love and was very tasty. We had coffee, tea an some fruit in our house, a nice touch! They told us about their hometown and the country and gave us tips for upcoming holidays.

I truly recommend this place for everyone planning a comfortable trip to the swedish capital and the amazing countryside and everyone who wants to get to know a friendy swedish family."
"6264",5574577,38119332,2015-07-13,21034450,"Lorna","We cannot recommend this place enough. 
The property is a spotless simple but lovely cabin separate from the main house and right next to the lake where you can swim and kayak (2 were available to borrow). The lake is clean, great for swimming in and has a wealth of wildlife you can sit back and watch.
Inside the cabin: the bed was very comfortable, plenty of storage was provided so no need to live out of your bag, lounge and dining areas were also small but any larger would have felt excessive. fruit and an expression machine were a nice addition too.
The spotless modern bathroom (for the guest's sole use) is in the basement of main house and accessed 24hrs via your own entrance so there's no worries about needing to walk through the family home.
the hosts Maria, Per & family were absolutely lovely and unbelievably welcoming, informative and friendly but never intrusive. Maria made a huge delicious breakfast every day which was delivered to the cabin in a wicker basket - she even laid it out for us on the lake side on our last day as we were still swimming back.
Local area: We pretty much chilled at the cabin for most of the time but there is a great small forest nearby for a walk - there's even lighting along the main paths and designating fire pit areas so you can enjoy it it the evenings too-. A good sized supermarket is a 10 minute stroll up the road and sells pretty much all you'd need and busses (zone A still!) to take you to a train or metro station are very close so you can be in central Stockholm in less then 45 mins. 
all in all a fantastic and super relaxing place to end our Stockholm adventure."

I immediately felt at home.  Great location! It was easy to get around.  Since I arrived during dinner time, I was invited to join the family and it was a great way of meeting and greeting each other.  You have a beautiful house and the room/cottage by the lake was beyond my expectations.  The lake was so peaceful that you can either kayak or go swimming.  The room was nicely decorated, cleaned and had a coffee maker, fresh fruit and snacks.  Maria and Per answered all questions and assisted me with what bus or train to take.

The fact we were not in the thick of it, did not matter whatsoever. It was surprisingly quick and easy to get in and out of the city... and we had a lake on our doorstep! Being in a  more tranquil setting was just what we needed, and I think, gave us a more rounded experience of (Website hidden by Airbnb) was just perfect! 

Maria and Per's daughters met us when we arrived, and later Maria and Per came over to introduce themselves; they were all incredibly welcoming, helpful and had great recommendations for current exhibitions, museums and places to see. 

One of the many great things of staying with Maria and Per, was the scrumptious and hearty breakfast that was left in a basket for us to collect every morning! It definitely added to the charm and experience of this place.

The help from the whole family gave me the confidence to use the public transport system in Stockholm - much cheaper than the taxis I used on my previous visits.

The apartment is lovely, in a great location, well-stocked, and spacious.  We were visiting a friend who has been living in Sweden for the past year, and he remarked how large and open it was.  
One thing I would note for anyone who has mobility issues is that, while the apartment building has an elevator, the quickest way from the building to the metro stop involves a few flights of stairs.  There is a lift at the stairs but it didn't always work.  Just FYI."

Stockholm is a very expensive city and Kleber is offering a very convenient solution here. I stayed 3 nights at his flat with my wife and my baby daughter and we were fine. The apartment itself is pretty small but beds were comfortable, bathroom clean and nicely renovated, and for us having a fridge and a microwave becomes quite useful with the child (we missed maybe having a small kitchen but we managed anyway). Location is also quite accurate, it takes max 7 min walk from the apartment to the Kista Galleria Mall (the biggest in Stockholm), which not only has 2 big supermarkets but also direct connection with the subway (tunelbanna) that takes you to the city centre in about 20 min. Kleber even borrowed us a couple of metro cards that we could just load with money to travel by subway (so he saved us the money for the cards), and he even offered me a parking place for my car for the 3 nights (free of charge). What can I say!?, We are definitively looking forward to stay at Kleber's studio again whenever we go to Stockholm!
Gracias Kleber por tu amable atencion!"

Next time in Stockholm I would try to book that place again! It has everything! Comfortable beds, bath room and a tiny kitchen corner! Also Kista Galleria is only 5 minute walk away, perfect shopping mall where you can buy everything and there is metro to city center, too! 15 minute only to the centre! highly recommended!!"

Moreover he also helped us by giving us metro cards and walking us to his place (he told us how to get to his house using the bus instead of metro from the airport and waited for us at the bus stop). We are very happy to have stayed at Kleber's place which by the way was huuuge! Overall, it was all perfect and Kleber is a great host, clean, good location, friendly, just like home! We are grateful and will def go back to his place on our next trip! Thanks tons Kleber for such a great stay even though it was only a night!"

"6356",5636187,40935457,2015-08-03,36210006,"Carolina","The area was quiet, near the centre and a short walk to the National park. I booked for two people, but finally only I went, which was good, since the apartment is great for one person but in my opinion it would not have been so comfortable for two: there was hardly any room left in the wardrobe to put away my clothes so I left them in the suitcase. However it was spacious, so that was no problem for me. Although it was only two rooms there was a kitchen area, dining area, sitting area and the bed area. 
The bed was a little small for a double (1.20), so I was glad it was just me!
It was also very bright with big windows and high ceilings and I felt very comfortable there. 
Kristina always answered my questions quickly by email and although I didn't meet her there was no problem. She was helpful and available. 
I did miss internet or wifi, but managed. 
Overall, if I go on my own to Stockholm I would stay there again. 
Thank you, Kristina

As wrote, the apartment is really lovely, at the best part of the city it can be. Old Town is 15 mins on foot, Djurgarden (Vasa museum, Skansen, etc...) is also reachable without using public trasnport.

Tip: Rent a bike at City Bike. There is a 3 days card for 240SEK, what is the best price by far.

Her location in the city of Stockholm is perfect-in a new trendy part of the city but within walking distance of Gamla Stan. Siw has detailed directions on how to find her place. She had helpful information on how to see the city. Her home was clean and comfortable. She was also a delight to talk with and get to know. I highly recommend staying here."

I was just in Stockholm for a layover so I only had one day to try to see as much as I could and Siwa gave me all the details I needed to know to make it happen, she is very helpful and is always happy to share her knowledge of he city with you. 
The breakfast she made for me the next day was delicious and she made a lot so I was full and very satisfied and every char I have with her was very interesting. I will def stay again with her if I return to Stockholm and for sure I will be staying more than 1 day."

She looked after me like a mum, I had drinks and fruit on arrival, desert when I arrived home after being out and she made sure I always had enough warm clothes before heading out. Siw loved to have a chat and made sure the place felt like your own. My booking was last minute and Siw's communication was quick and she was very accommodating helping me out.

Right after that, she sent me a very detailed guide telling me how to transport from airport to her home which really helps. Several days before my arrival, she contacted me to confirm my arrival time and answerred all my questions. During my stay, Siwa was always willing to give me advice about how to make full use of my stay visiting the great places in Stockholm. She even made coffee for me in the morning and the coffee is really good!  Her home is really a cozy place. I'd recommand you to stay at Siwa's house if you want to live as local."

The room was very comfortable and Siw really went out of her way to give us privacy. It's a charming little apartment in a great location - walking distance to the best of Sodermalm and the Old City, or take a short metro trip. 

In the morning, Siw offers a breakfast for an additional 30 kronas/person. One of us ate and it was delicious!"

She gave me very good tips about Stockholm and what to do there. She took the time to explain me parts of Swedish culture and she also made me try some typical Swedish food. It was very nice from her! One of her friend was visiting her and she was as nice and lovely as Siwa! 
Her house is very nice and well situated; it makes it very easy to visit the city.
I would highly recommend to say there if you get the chance!"

She was there before the stay to answer our questions by emails (and send us a very helpful guide to find her place), but also during our stay and after to hear news from the rest of our trip. 

She is so nice and kindly. She made us feel us very welcome to her place.

Her place is small but so cosy, so warm, it is a real pleasure to come home in the evenning after a long day visiting the city ! :)

The location is ideally situated : just near the metro and barely 10-15 min walk from the old center.

If you are searching a perfect place to stay to visit Stockholm, Siwa's home is just perfect :)"

Ich und vier Freundinnen buchten das vollständige Appartment für vier Tage und wir fühlten uns rundum wohl. Das Appartment ist sehr hell, sauber, gross und ausserordentlich gemütlich eingerichtet. Jan und seine Familie hiessen uns herzlich willkommen und gaben uns viele nützliche Informationen über die Stadt und die Umgebung. Besonderen Dank an Jan, der bis zum Schluss darum besorgt war, dass uns das Taxi rechtzeitig an den Flughafen brachte! Wir waren begeistert und können das Appartment jedem empfehlen. Bei einem nächsten Aufenthalt in Stockholm würden wir wieder bei Jan buchen! Viele Grüsse aus der Schweiz!"

Jan was very welcoming and flexible and just left us to it. He gave us a great welcome and left leaflets for us to find things to do."
"6411",5653862,40082500,2015-07-28,30165344,"Tony","The apartment was described as luxurious and it did not disappoint.   Wonderfully situated close to all the attractions of Stockholm, the apartment was our home for 4 nights.   It was well equipped, clean, tidy and all together perfect for us.   Jan was excellent in pre trip communications and was charming and friendly.  Jan was waiting for us when we arrived and had provided us with groceries and soft drinks which was both kind and considerate.  I can highly recommend this apartment for a break in Stockholm, surely Europe's most well kept secret.  Top marks from the Smiths!"
"6412",5655177,47854856,2015-09-21,43952995,"Paul","John kindly took me on at very short notice even though he wasn't going to be in Stockholm  himself. However he gave me great directions for finding his place and very detailed instructions for picking up the key. The room itself is big and comfortable and has a nice little balcony attached for when the sun shines! I think John is quite right when he says that the location gives you the best of both worlds - you are within easy reach of the city centre (thanks to Stockholm's excellent Tunnelbana system) but Hammarbyhöjden is a nice quiet area to recuperate after a hard day's sightseeing. John was great at keeping in touch with me throughout my stay by email etc and gave me helpful tips and advice. I would definitely recommend a stay here !"
"6413",5658309,37506283,2015-07-07,36186821,"Anniek","This is a lovely house! We stayed here with four people and were welcomed by one of the family members, even though we arrived very late in the evening. The beds were good, the kitchen is perfect if you want to prepare some meals and to make some coffee. During our stay the weather was nice so we could sit outside and use the bikes. The metro is really close by and within a 10 minute ride you are in the city centre of Stockholm. The neighbourhood was quite and the people living around the house super friendly. The cats live mostly outside, if you give them some food and water every once in a while it's fine. One of them likes to be cuddled :) I would absolutely recommend you this house!"

Nous avons énormément apprécié votre maison qui est dans un quartier très calme, agréable et très proche du centre.
Notre séjour a été parfaitement réussi grâce à ce logement très fonctionnel et très bien décoré.
Bravo aussi pour votre traversée en bateau que nous avons pu suivre sur votre blog.

A bientôt et vive Stockholm.

"6415",5658309,40715208,2015-08-02,29505960,"Leonid","We stayed in the house of Ase and Micke in July 2015. We liked the place as it was presented at airbnb - in reality we found it even much better. The house is nicely decorated in all its parts that created a very warm atmosphere. Each room is carefully provided with everything you would need to feel yourself comfortable as at home. We were exempted from buying such things as toilet paper, paper towels, liquid soaps, detergent, plastic sandwich bags, foil paper and so on saying nothing of food first necessities such as salt, oil, sugar, coffee, tea, spices... Arriving at such place, you can relax and enjoy your vacation from the very first minute. All the facilities looked new and worked perfectly. Besides, I would like to emphasize two more important details of our stay: Ase and Micke let us use their bicycles - it was very kind of them and this contributed a lot to our vacation activities (the Enskede area is perfect for bicycle walks); a nicely equipped backyard can allow you a lot when it is in combination with good weather conditions.
We stayed at the house when Ase and Micke were abroad but our full support was thoughtfully organized by them in advance. On our arrival, we were greeted by their elder daughter who also made a perfect introduction to the house for us. All the period we stayed in touch with Ase via e-mails. 
The location of the house is very convenient for both going to the city (10 minutes walk + 15 minutes by tunnelban to the Old City) and spending time in the nearby parks. The supermarket is next to the tunnelban station. 
We had great two weeks in the Wonderful Twin House and warmly recommend it to everybody!"
"6416",5658309,42137051,2015-08-11,35583757,"Christine","Ich war mit meinen beiden Teenager-Töchtern bei Ase und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Mit der Schlüsselübergabe hat alles gut geklappt, Ase selbst haben wir nicht kennengelernt, aber es war alles gut vorbereitet. Die Nachbarn sind nett und die Umgebung ist sehr schön. In der City von Stockholm waren wir innerhalb kurzer Zeit. Auch die beiden Katzen sind sehr zutraulich und lieb.
Wir würden jederzeit wieder zu Ase fahren."
"6417",5667435,48790414,2015-09-28,19356511,"Kristin","I HIGHLY recommend staying in Pontus' apartment - I ended up extending my stay for an extra night because of my time there.  The apartment looks just like the photos and is extremely spacious, clean, quiet and relaxing.  I wasn't sure if any of his neighbors were home, because it was literally so quiet - but I did see some come and go so knew that they were just generally respectful.  The bed was SUPER comfortable and Pontus' kitchen has every appliance and kitchen gadget you would need.  And, this may not be important to some people but the hairdryer was fantastic, I am buying the same one!
Location wise, it is VERY VERY central and in a really nice / one of the best neighborhoods - it's close to the t-ban, Stureplan, grocery stores, restaurants and parks.  Going on the t-ban and arlanda express, I think I was checked in and through Arlanda's terminal 5 security in 1.25 hours after leaving Pontus' apartment on my way home!   
Pontus left directions on how to use things (well, the televison, garbage closet etc) in his apartment which were easy to follow even though I am confused with technology!.  Pontus also left his phone number - despite also being on vacation when I stayed there, he always responded and made himself available for some questions I had and was very easy to work with.

Location is great, overlooking the river and park area in south Sodermalm - the coolest area in Stockholm. A pleasant walk will take you right into the Old Town. 
The apartment is really nice, clean, filled with art and fully equipped for a very comfortable stay. A visit to the supermarket up the street and you are ready to cook and eat and feel like you are at home.
The apartment is on the 4th floor, there is an elevator.

After exploring the sites during the day, the open, airy space with views of the park provided a perfect respite for cocktails and light fare on the balcony. The apartment is immaculately clean and very comfortable.
The location couldn't be better -- close to transit and grocery options -- allowing for a true feeling of living like a local.  
Though we didn't have an opportunity to meet them, perusing the titles in the bookshelf and art on the walls provided insight into this art-focused couple and their family.  Thank you for sharing your home.
Highly recommended for the perfect stay in Stockholm.

And the place is beautiful, in a beautiful, convenient location. Close to the subway and busses, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. There is a party area up the street about a 5-10 minute walk, but far enough away that you don't notice the commotion unless you really seek it out.

So thoughtful! They had maps of the area for us with directions to the local grocery stores and parks. The apartment was just as it was in the pictures and very comfortable. Really nice updated bathroom and kitchen. It is also really close to the subway and a beautiful park on the water. Great area to explore and easy to get to other parts of Stockholm.

(We were sorry we didn't get a chance to meet Sara and Henrik in person, as they seem awesome!)   Sara was super quick in all communications, and super helpful.  It was a great bonus to have the kids toys  (very nearly contained a bin) around,  and also the crib and high chair for our 1-year old. 
 Their place is just as great as it looks in the pictures,  and possibly even bigger that it looks. It was very modern and super clean, and the location was great.  The beach was really close with a couple of nice cafes right on the water, and Hornstull  subway stop was super close.

Sara even left us maps and local and city information with thoughtful tips and suggestions as to what to see & do in the area. We always received prompt and friendly replies to our many inquiries. The subway (Tunnelbana) station just around the corner (Hornstull, Red Line) is just 4 stops from historic Gamla Stan (Old Town), less than a 10 minute ride, and just 2 or 3 stops in Sodermalm's centre (Mariatorget & Slussen stations) for great bars, cafes and shopping, and just 6 to Central Station.   Adjacent to Hornstull station, just a block away, is a nice Hemkop Supermarket and Systembolaget (Liquor Store) and great Swedish breads and pastries at Fabrique.  This apartment was an ideal base in a friendly quiet area from which we explored Stockholm.  A nice Sunday morning market takes place on Hornstull Strand  just around the corner.  Though we got 7 day SL (for Tunnelbana / bus / tram / commuter train) unlimited use passes (300SEK) which are great value, know that a Flygbussarna bus direct from Arlanda airport (be sure to get the one that ends at Liljeholmen) also stops just around the corner at Hornstull station as well.   Thanks again to Sara & Henrik, we hope to stay again!"

She showed us how everything worked, recycling/trash info, etc. and provided us with some neighborhood tips and dining recommendations. Görel had also left us an assortment of attraction brochures and cafe suggestions.

 The  apartment looked exactly as pictured. The unit was clean, and everything was in good working order. It was beautifully decorated and quite spacious. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the building is very quiet. We never even heard any neighbors.

 Several public transit options are nearby, including a bus stop around the corner. Additionally, the light rail line from the airport is about a 10 minute walk away. (On this same rail line, the Stockholmassen is only one stop away if you happen to be in town for a conference or exhibition.)  Two T-Bana stations are also nearby. You can be virtually anywhere in the tourist areas of Stockholm within 30 minutes or less from the building.

 Should you wish to spend a day in the neighborhood, there are many things to see nearby. It is a short walk to the water which has a nice path leading to Tonto Södra, an allotment garden of 111 spaces located in a park. Numerous restaurants can also be found in the neighborhood.

 We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Görel's condo and would love to return. She was always available by email and cell phone and was very helpful. In fact I needed to hire a photographer while I was in town, and she connected me to the right people. She truly went above and beyond as a host.

I appreciated how quickly she got back to me and how thoughtful she was. Prior to arrival, Görel pulled together information that would be useful to travelers new to the area, and it was so helpful. She was not in the area during the duration of our visit and appointed someone to greet us when we arrived, give us basic instructions for using appliances and how to \"check-out\" at the end of our stay, as well as how to contact this person during our stay if we had any problems.

The point person was not always as prompt in communication, but was helpful when responding. There was a minor maintenance issue that required immediate assistance, and this person was not able to provide assistance for 24 hours. That was the only challenge throughout our experience.

The home and building are secure and in great condition! It is very near the bus and train. We really enjoyed our time at Görel's place and appreciated how accommodating she was."

I was in Stockholm for work, so it was never an issue, but I should mention that there's construction of the hospital next door so some noise first thing in the morning.

We couldn't have asked for a better accommodation while we stayed in Stockholm :) Isabella replied to every message in between a few minutes and tried to make our stay as great as possible.

It's a bit small depending on what you're used to, but for a short stay it was fine.  Has wifi, which is of course convenient.  The one minor glitch I had was with check-in time.  I had asked the owner Isabella what time check-in was far in advance so I could book my trip from Gothenburg accordingly.  She told me noon, so we booked our flights based on that.  A couple days before, Isabella told us we wouldn't be able to check in until 5:30 pm because of a plumber appointment.  I said no problem, but that we'd just like to drop off our bags.  This was not an option.  So we had to go to the train station and put our luggage in lockers after we arrived from the airport.  It was just an extra hassle that I would have rather avoided, given the fact that I purposely asked in advance about check-in time and made arrangements accordingly."

Everything we could have asked for was just around the corner so we rarely took any public transports as you can walk easily to almost every viewable spot.

The room,washroom and the kitchen are clean and well kept. Its a nice lovely house. 
Sofia is a nice host. She is very very helpful and infact when my wife needed some medical attention, she even accompanied us to the hospital and helped us a lot. 
It is a good place overall and I will definitely recommend staying there!"

The room is large, the beds are comfortable and the desk and wardrobe are very convenient. We appreciated the breakfast of course, as well as the friendly way she provides a little candy along with the towels, but also the interesting conversation with Sofia.

There are also plenty of stores and restaurants in the vicinity. The accommodation was very clean. I cannot stress this enough. The beds were outstandingly comfortable. I slept like the King of of Sweden. Sofia's flat was overall very cozy for instance there were fresh roses in the kitchen. Sofia was also very helpful and we had a really good and long chat during and after breakfast. She has a very positive attitude and a radiant smile that you can only love. You can tell that she's an experienced traveler herself and therefore knows how to make you feel welcome.

Many thanks to Joakim, who was out in these days in Sweden, but did everything possible that we were settled without any problems and got the maximum pleasure from stay in his apartment! The apartment is small but cozy and clean, with everything you need, on a quiet street. The ten minute walk to the Underground. Approximately 20 minutes from T-Centralen. Grocery stores, cafes? bars - all close to home. Ten minutes walk to the other side - a large shopping mall Bromma Blocks (Galleria, InterSport, Stadium and many many others shops and cafes). Beautiful promenade along the canal. The possibility of free parking along the street near the house. Excellent and inexpensive place for one or two people. I recommend 100%!

The apartment is located very central and the neighborhood is lively but windows closed you don't hear anything within the living space.  Apart from that it's just a minute walk to the next supermarket and some more steps to the metro or bus station. 

If you want to spend your days in Stockholm in a very bright, noble and welcoming atmosphere, this accommodation won't disappoint you!"

Man kann aber auch vieles zu Fuss machen oder mit dem Bus (hält aber in der Nähe). Ich war mit meiner Nichte dort und die Aufteilung mit Schlafzimmer und Sofa im Wohnzimmer hat für uns sehr gut gepaßt. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet, wir haben sie allerdings nur für einmal Frühstück genutzt. Insgesamt ist die Wohnung großzügig wie auf den Bildern zu sehen. Die Kommunikation mit Susanna hat super geklappt und trotz Poststreik hat es mit der Schlüsselübergabe  funktioniert. Leider haben wir uns nicht persönlich getroffen.
Ich fahre gerne wieder nach Stockholm und in Susannas Wohnung! Sehr gut geeignet für einen Städtetrip in Stockholm.

Die Einrichtung bietet alles, was für einen mehrtätigen Aufenthalt vonöten ist und stimmt mit der Beschreibung im Internet und den Fotos vollkommen überein. Die Anbindung zum Stadtzentrum ist mit der U-Bahn hervorragend, zu Fuß erreicht man das Zentrum innerhalb von 30 bis 45 min mit einem sehr reizvollen Spaziergang. Södermalm ist ein sympathisches Stadtviertel, großstädtisch ohne City-Rummel und mit einer buntgemischten Infrastruktur und Einwohnerschaft von hip bis bodenständig.

The small kitchen comes in handy to prepare breakfast or lunch. The bathroom is small but sufficient, only the toilet leaves people over 1,75 meter (like me) no room for their knees.
To us, it was not really romantic, for that there was not enough attention paid to the decoration. But it certainly is attractive.
The neighbourhood of the Ringvagen is perfect with lots of small restaurants, cafés, shops and parks. The distance to the subway is ten minutes.
Susanne organised everything perfectly. We had our keys in time and the explanation of the apartment was clear. So we would book this apartment again in the future.

Linens are not included and so be prepared to bring your own towels, sheets and pillowcases (or pay significantly extra). Also note that you will need to post the keys back to Germany after you return home. The heating was fine, but I imagine if it got much colder it could have been a problem. Still, the place was clean and very located in Sofo which was the coolest part of town."

The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet, and set right against the beautiful river. It is very close to public transportation , and a wonderful bakery right around the corner. The apartment was very clean, and the sleeping accommodations were great. Tima was especially kind to her guests, and even provided us food in the refrigerator. She even provided us with an iPad that we were free to use! I would absolutely recommend staying in this apartment, and would stay here again on a return trip to Stockholm."

She was kind enough to prepare some food for us and allow us to use any food/ingredients we could find in her kitchen. We stayed in Tima ' s home for 5 days for our visit to Stockholm. Her place is very spacious and the view from the terrace  to the bay is great! The neighborhood is very quiet and metro station is 8-10 min walk. The trains are so frequent that going to downtown Stockholm is a matter of 20 min.

It was easy to access all the major attractions and there were great restaurants nearby. The apartment is large and well outfitted. It could have been a little cleaner upon arrival and we had difficulty checking in since Hampus did not meet us there and instead left a key. Unfortunately the building itself was locked by code which we did not receive upon booking. We were able to sort it out but it took a little while. We also had difficulty obtaining the wifi password since no instructions were left in the apartment. Overall, I would recommend confirming all details prior to arrival for a smoother stay if you do not have an international phone/data plan."

The apartment is exactly as described. The wifi is fast, the kitchen has everything one would need, and the view is worth a few extra kronors.

A little more background for those who care reading. Due to a delay in the renovation of our new flat, my family and I (who by the way live in Stockholm) needed a place to stay for a few nights before we could move in to our new home.

Peder was an amazing host, always avail to answer any questions very quickly and super friendly. The location could not be more amazing, you are in the best part of Sodermalm, which is the best area of Stockholm. All of the great food/bars are just a few minutes walk away, definitely try Urban Deli! The Fotografiska Museum is only about 10 minutes walk, it's amazing and has a great bar/restaurant on top floor that you should not miss. Gamla Stan (Old Town) is also walking distance. We got CityBike passes from the 7-11 right near Peder's place and rode ALL over Stockholm, it's a great way to see the city!

The apartment is walk-up (ie no elevator), so pack light! Also, when we were there the sun was rising at 4am, be aware there are no shades on the windows, so bring an eye mask if you're bothered by am light.

Before coming I texted back and forth to arrange for the keys and everything went very smoothly. The area was really cool and calm, away from the touristic part - a perfect palce to stay and only 5-10 min. walk from the tube station.

You can also walk from Liljeholmen by a lake then right along the coast, cafes on the way!  It is easy to get to the city centre and when we arrived we got a bus from the airport to Liljeholmen which is one stop in the tube so we did not have to come via the city centre."

Clean towels and additional blankets awaited for us, too.

One should better thoroughly follow Matilda's instructions about transport - these are really the fastest and easiest ways to get to this place or back to the city centre. Nevertheless you may like to have a walk to the station instead of taking the bus, as long as the area is cosy and quiet too with grocery store just around the corner.

They met me at the Stockholm train station for my 21.30 inbound arrrval from Oslo, and we strolled like old mates, not having met for a few decades, back to her place in Mariatorget.  I felt like family, and the walk allowed an introduction to this fair-haired princess of a city as we passed City Hall and Gamla Stan and more.
Their place is on the fifth (top) floor with more charm, both in the rooftop perch and views afar, and in the intensely personal and artfully decorated interiors filled with objet d'art, much by their own hands.  I felt as though we'd been related in some other world.  It's a rich, beautiful, idiosyncratic, but fully- and well-appointed residence with lots of room. Yes, it has all the basic amenities, but so much more.   It's seductive powers are so great they may even keep you indoors, and apart from this gorgeous city's man many charms.  Be forewarned.

And Maria and Mats too?  I can't say too many good things about these beautiful people.  They had all sorts of suggestions as well as attentively responding to my needs and desires too.  You enter a very rich and warm world with these hosts.
I will be back and would not even consider staying anywhere else, lest, of course, this place is booked.

It was literally right on the hip Mariatorget park, a couple minutes walk to a metro, a few minutes walk to the water overlooking the old town, and walking distance to Gamla Stan. And that's not even mentioning the interior of the apartment. We felt like we were in an interior designer's own place, designed with an eye to rustic and antique comfort. 
This space would be an excellent hideaway in the city for a couple as the two beds are next to each other. Maria was a very accommodating host. I highly recommend it.

The location of Maria's apartment was nothing short of perfect - we could walk to the Old Town, we took a ferry to Djurgarden and we took a fabulous boat trip to the Stockholm archipelago and we could access all of this on foot.  We loved the \"artiness\" of the apartment.  It was light, airy and had all the facilities we needed.  We used the outdoor space every evening as the weather was superb.  Maria had kindly left us some supplies and we used the kitchen and laundry facilities with ease.  We particularly loved the eclectic and stylish collection of kitchenware (the Swedes do this well!).  Maria herself was very welcoming and easily contactable with answers to our questions.  It was so much more personal than a hotel and we felt we got to know Stockholm better because of it.

From the heated floors and designer soap in the bathroom, to the carefully manicured living room, Ludwig left no detail to chance.  As you enter the apartment, you are greeted by a long hallway that leads to an open living room drenched in sunlight - a blessing in Stockholm.  All the furniture in the living room and the adjacent kitchen is super modern and immaculate and the open area allows for socializing while cooking.  On the other end of the hallway you find the bathroom - complete with shower and bathtub - as well as the quiet sanctuary that is the bedroom.  Nestled low to the ground, the bed gives the feeling of true peace after a long and busy day out on the town.  While in Stockholm, I did a lot of exploring and Ludwig was very helpful with expert recommendations for the city: he pointed out all the cool new restaurants in town (the majority of which are in his neighborhood) and recommended the city's great museums (my favorite was the Fotografiska).  Overall, my stay at Ludwig's apartment was a joy and exceeded the quality one might expect in a 5-star hotel.  Thanks again to Ludwig and I hope to visit Stockholm again soon!"

L'alloggio ha tutto quello che serve ed è ipertecnologico (serve un minimo per capire come funzionano i vari dispositivi: dalle luci al piano di cottura a induzione o al forno). Nel quartiere vi sono negozi, supermercati caffè e ristoranti per chi non vuole spostarsi molto.

They provided full access to bathroom, kitchen and living room. And offered even the use of stereo and television. 
The apartment, as well as the room, is marvelous and clean. The room might appear small, however it is very pretty and enough space for one person and baggage.
Furthermore the area is calm, safe and there is a nice path along the water around the area. The house is easy to find and with the metro it takes about 5 - 8 minutes to the central station. 
The breakfast provided is excellent and sufficient. And what is more, when I arrived I found a lovely arranged folder with maps and information.
Elin and Martin are polite, respectful and really fun to speak with. I had an awesome stay.

Für mich war alles ziemlich aufregend, da es meine erste Reise allein war, ich war zum ersten Mal in Schweden und es war das erste Mal mit airbnb! Und es war die beste Entscheidung! Elin und Martin sind sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Menschen und ich bin sehr froh die Beiden kennengelernt zu haben. Die Wohnung war modern, gemütlich und sauber, so wie auf den Bildern. Ich mochte auch das Zimmer, das zwar klein, aber für eine Person, meiner Meinung nach, ausreichend ist. Abends haben wir oft zusammen im Wohnzimmer gesessen und uns unterhalten. Zum Frühstück konnte ich mich aus dem Kühlschrank selbst bedienen und mir auch mal für unterwegs noch ein Sandwich machen. Die Wohnung ist sehr central gelegen. Man kann alles bequem zu Fuß erreichen. 10 Minuten zur Bushaltestelle des Flughafentransfers, 2 Minuten zur Metro, in 5 Minuten ist man im Park und ich bin auch sehr gerne am Wasser entlang in ca. 30 Minuten in die Altstadt gelaufen. Auch Check in und out waren sehr flexibel möglich, was für mich absolut perfekt war. Ich hatte wirklich eine unglaublich tolle Zeit in Stockholm. Nochmal ganz lieben Dank euch beiden Elin und Martin

The apartment is close to a T Station: within 10 minutes to the city center.
The reason of my journey to Stockholm was a photo job at the wedding of Prince Carl Phillip and Sofia that weekend. I hope the next stay in Stockholm will be with less work.
Elin and Martin are kind people. I definitely want to come back!"

Elin and Martin welcomed me in person when I arrived. The apartment was recently renovated and it was spacious, clean and modern. The room was small but clean and cozy. Towels and shower gel/shampoo were provided. The bathroom was clean and modern. The location is about 2 min walk to the closest subway station. Knowing that I was interested in seeing interior design, Elin came up with a few places which I really enjoyed visiting. Highly recommended to stay with Elin and Martin if you visit Stockholm!"
"6651",5907890,38362866,2015-07-14,8624043,"Maria","Clean, modern and central. Elin was very friendly, helpful and easy to communicate with. She came home from work just so I could check in early which I really appreciated. The room is very small, it would have been fine if I didn't have 2 bags (one huge). It was hard to open it in that small room. But for someone who doesn't have a lot of luggage its a great place. Its a small place so if you want privacy I would not suggest this place. However Elin is a really sweet person so if you don't mind to chat with her and her boyfriend and be around them when you are in their home you will probably love to stay here."

It was very clean and pretty much, as described in the posting. Their instructions were quite easy too. They were flexible with my check-in and were nice enough to help me with recommendations, especially since I was new to Stockholm. The apartment itself is probably best suited for a single traveler looking for a quieter neighborhood to stay in. Overall, Elin and Martin were very accommodating and I would recommend them as hosts."

The flat is very clean and I slept very well in the bed.
The bathroom is very clean too. I felt very comfortable.

I recommend it for your stay in Stockholm. 
Metro station is 5 min walk and there are buses nearby to. And it's 30 min walking distance from Central Station, and 35 min from Gamla Stan."

On my first day Martin even prepared a nice meal, and I already felt at home ^_^. Throughout my stay Elin & Martin both gave me great tips and recommendations about Stockholm, they also helped me with everything I needed (like how to get to the airport late at night). It was really great to talk each day with them and to get to know them. They are very warm, friendly and easy going.
 
The flat itself is located in a very quiet residential area, just a minute's walk away from the t-bana station as well as restaurants and supermarkets. From the t-bana station it is very easy and *fast* to get to all the other parts of Stockholm - perfect for sight-seeing!  While I have seen other people say the room is quite small, I felt that it was perfect for a single traveller like myself. You have a few shelves to put your belongings, as well as a side table. The room also has a nice TV , a great view of the garden and the bed is really comfortable. The flat is very modern and clean and the heated floors in the bathroom are a delight! In addition, there is a nice breakfast each morning!  

It was a joy living here for the past week, and I really recommend staying with Martin & Elin. See you two soon! :D"

The room is cozy, warm, extremely clean and has all a visitor/tourist would need from a healthy breakfast, hygiene essentials to guides for travel around Stockholm, down to a jar of sweets (nice touch). The couple indeed has thought about everything you would need so that you focus on what brought you there.

Both the apartment and the neighborhood is quiet. Just what you need for a good night sleep after a long day. 

Having traveled around themselves, they have interacted with different persons and therefore are quite relatable and we had good conversations. 

As my first experience with AirBnB, it lived up to my expectations, and then some. 

Thank you Elin and Martin! You rock like rock, paper scissors :)"

The location is also very good especially when traveling by car, since the apartment is close to the highway. The metro is very close, which makes it easy to come around in Stckholm. 
 
I can warmly recommend this apartment."

The nice, sunny, tidy and fully equipped apartment is situated on the 10th  floor on a small hill and offers a great view over Stockholm. The underground station Liljeholmen is just a 5 minutes walk, providing excellent connection to everywhere in the city (and the direct bus from Arlanda Airport also halts here - very convenient!).

However, he sent his son, Alex, to welcome us at McDonald near the station. Alex showed us around the house, how to access internet, and so on. The apartment is located near the bus and train station (10 minutes walk). Liljehomen bus stop is connected directly with the Arlanda Airport. The train and bus stations are also located nearby, so the transportation is quite convenient. The room is clean and cozy. And the kitchen is nice and well equipped. The most important thing is that, we can contact our host at any time during our stays. Overall, we are happy and his apartment made our stays in Stockholm and our first experience with AirBnB more enjoyable."

Cesar was very kind and contacted us before arrival to clarified all details, he met us near a building in a day we arrived, showed everything inside. 
We were very happy with this fully equipped, clean and tidy apartment and it's location. It's only 5 mins to a nearest metro station (using a shortcut through the shopping center; the entrance to Liljeholmen T-bana station is in the shopping centre on the 1st floor), it's 15 minutes by T-bana to a Gamla Stan. You can find everything you need (food stores, pharmacy, souvenir store, etc.) inside that shopping centre (Liljeholmstorget Galleria). You can buy Stockholm cards (for museums and public transport) directly inside the Liljeholmen T-bana station. If you have a car - you can park it for free near the next buildings on the street, there is always free places there. 
If you are looking for a great place to stay in Stockholm - I would highly recommend this apartment. 
Thank you, Cesar! :)

An apartment at 10th floor on top of a hill, gives you the best Stockholm view the nature can offer, outdoor; and a very pleasing view Cesar can offer; indoor with his awesomely prepared apartment. Located near Liljeholmen Gallery and metro station, there is also a Halal kebab store and an Asian market if that concerns any of you. But the most important thing is, I will remember Cesar as an important part of the sweet memory I had during my stay in Stockholm, even though we only met for a very short time when he handed the apartment key to me. I hope I can treat him equally nice when some day he and his family visit my country. Thank you Cesar. Thank you Stockholm.

The unit is in a corner of the tallest building in an inclined area that afforded a great view of Stockholm with picture windows to really appreciate a 270 degrees vista. We only have to walk to the shopping center/mall area where the Liljeholmen station for bus and T-bahn rides and we are off to explore the city. It was really comforting to come back and rest in the well provided neat and tidy apartment after our tour.  The trip to the airport was a breeze as the Airport bus has a pickup point near the mall."

Asunto oli siisti ja sieltä löytyi kaikki tarvittava kuten liinavaatteet, WLAN, ruoanlaittovälineet ja astiat. Pyykinpesukone oli alakerrassa ja sen saattoi varata hyvinkin lyhyellä varoitusajalla. Alue on rauhallinen ja näkymät ikkunasta ja parvekkeelta mahtavat.

Needless to say that the apartment is fully equipped suitable not only for a short stay but for a long one as well. What completes all the above and makes the apartment exceptional is that it is just next to a square with a commercial center. Many shops, restaurants and supermarkets, and many buses and the subway (metro) station are just there. Also, the bus from the Arlanda airport goes directly to this square.

Cesar himself is a very welcoming person, very accurate and exact in his communication, before, during and after arriving.

Clean, neat, charming and had everything I needed. Although Paulina was out of the country, she was accessible via (Hidden by Airbnb) , although I did not need anything urgent at all. 
I particularly enjoyed the balcony that looks over the inner courtyard of the block of flats. Although the block is right on Gotgatan, which is a very hip and buzzing road, it is at the back, and the double-glazed windows mean the apartment is quiet and peaceful. 
I would really recommend this apartment. It's less than one minute walk to the Skanstull T-bahn station, and it's great to be in Sodermalm, as it is a cool neighbourhood with amazing restaurants, shops etc."

I was tempted to use Airb&b for the first occasion and my expectations were exceeded by the apartment I chose. 
It's location is close enough to the city centre to be able to walk there in 20 mins, but is remote enough within a pleasent residential area, with numerous good restaurants and coffee shops close by. 
The apartment itself is bright, airy and uncluttered, with high ceilings and tasteful decor. Being someone who is extremely fussy about where I stay / sleep. I was delighted. 
I met Caroline on arrival and she was welcoming, courteous and efficient in my briefing. 
On my next visit to the City, I would hope that her apartment is available for use again.

Se puede ir caminando al centro, en unos 20 minutos, pero finalmente cogíamos el metro o el tren ( una sola parada) para ir y venir, para no añadir más caminata a lo que ya supone la visita a una ciudad.

The location is literally 2 mins (walking) away from the subway, and very accessible and quite close to the city centre. John provided me with detailed directions to his place.  :)
Buying groceries is not a problem if you plan to cook at home, there is a store very close by. The neighbouthood is peaceful, family-oriented and green. Some street noise was audible in my room though. The apartment doesn't have a living room/communal space, but I found the size of the room pretty reasonable and I had easy access to the kitchen area. Everything is exactly as shown in the pictures. 
John made me feel very comfortable and at home. For most of my stay I was sharing the apartment with John's flatmate, who was a lovely person to live with. The rent was reasonable relative to other Airbnb postings, but you can definitely find more affordable places if you are planning a longer visit and can look for places while in Stockholm."

Aron left some documentation about Stockholm and gave us all explanations necessary to easily access the place. More of that he promptly answered all our questions before and during our stay. 
The neighbourhood is quiet. There is a park with playgrounds for kids. 
It is true that Bagarmossen is not in the inner city but it is very accessible with the metro (about 20 to 30 min from Gamla Stan). ICA and Coop is near the metro station, so it was easy to the necessary when coming back from the city after a long visiting day ;)

The appartement was clean, nice, complete and big enough for a family of 5 (3 big boys). All the equipement (oven, shower, wifi, etc.) worked well.
The neighbourhood is quiet and clean. The appartement is on the groundfloor of an appartementbuilding, it borders on a patio. All doors can be well-locked, we did not feel unsafe in any way.
A supermarket and small shoppingcentre (pharmacie, food-to-go, etc.) is on 3 minutes walking distance, 1 minute further is the metro-line that goes directly into the city.
All together it was the ideal operating base to visit Stockholm from here for 3 days. We've been to other city's in Europe (with other organisations then Airb&b), so we are a bit experienced with this formula. I can easily say that this appartement has been the best so far and that we would recommend this appartement to our friends."

My stay in Stockholm was very pleasant thanks to Victor and his comfy and welcoming home.

It was easy to reach by metro from T-Centralen thanks to its close proximity to the Skanstull station, where the metro and buses leave with high frequency. The neighbourhood itself is a beautiful one, located on Sodermalm, the hip and bustling southern island of Stockholm. A great place to wake up every day! 

When it comes to the apartment and its facilities, nothing to complain here. I slept well on the airmatrass he provided, which was very comfortable. The shower and the toilet were clean and worked perfectly.

It located in a very quiet and peaceful residential area. You can get to the nearest train station (Skanstull) in 5-6mins by walk.
And the location is perfectly convenient to do anything you would like to!
And you can have a beautiful and stimulating walk around that hip area (Sodermalm) and you can explore so many pretty things there.
I’ve visited many pretty and iconic places in Stockholm but my most precious memory in Stockholm is the night sitting around the table with Victor’s girlfriend and her loveliest mum, chatting about our cultural differences or many things about our lives. That night was so irreplaceable experience and more beautiful than any other gorgeous architectures in Stockholm. And that’s is exactly one of the reasons why I like to travel with Airbnb. It feels like as if I were belonging in the city.
Victor is always very kind and ready to help you. And his girlfriend is very caring and has the sweetest heart. I am so blessed to stay with them and I dearly recommend you to stay with them to make your stay in Stockholm much more fabulous :)))"

There is an outdoor farmer's market nearby on Saturdays and locals enjoying their coffees outside on good-weather Sundays.

"6763",6033911,37194839,2015-07-05,8144166,"You","David was an incredibly amazing host. I had the best airbnb experience so far with him. His generosity went much beyond what one would expect from a host—simply put, he became a good friend during my stay. He’s a very open and warm person with a lot of funny and interesting stories (like his experience of two-weeks training for becoming a buddhist monk at a Japanese temple). He took me to swim in amazing lakes, made lunch together (well, I didn’t do much), we biked around Stockholm (he lent me one), and had an amazing night at a sauna next to a lake, going back and forth the heated room and the cool waters. My only regret is that I had some research to do in Stockholm, which prevented me from spending more time with him (he invited me to camp out with him and his friends, etc). His place is a gem, very clean with everything you need, including the best drier I’ve ever used. It is located near the center of town, short walk to the station, and with a lot of places to eat including a great vegan pizza/kebab place, and a super market that is open until 11pm. I not only recommend this place to anyone visiting Stockholm, but I want to come back again just to stay there and hang out with David. Thanks so much for your kindness David, and please keep in touch. I hope we can hang out again soon in Stockholm, New York, or Tokyo!"

However, even better is to rent city bikes as one of the city bike stations is almost next to the apartment. The place was very clean and well appointed.

It is stylish but homely and a pleasure to come home to after a long day sightseeing.  It was clean, spacious and well-equipped, with lots of quirky touches, and a little balcony which would have been nice to use had the weather been better.  
Although it is located a little way from the centre of Stockholm, it took us just 12 minutes to reach Gamla Stan by the 76 bus.  The tunnelbana station is 10 minutes walk away, but the trains were so regular and ran until late that we made good use of them.  The neighbourhood is residential and generally very quiet and safe.
We were greeted by Anders’s mother, Ingrid, who was delightful and provided us with lots of information to get us started on our week’s visit.  Anders kept in touch before and during our stay and was always very helpful.  He popped in to say Goodbye when we left and couldn’t have been nicer – we hope to see him again sometime.

La signora è stata molto carina e gentile, ci ha accompagnate in casa e ci ha spiegato un sacco di cose sulla città e sul quartiere, oltre che sulla casa, lasciandoci anche molto materiale.
La casa è carina e confortevole, ci è piaciuta molto. Il quartiere è molto verde e servito bene dai mezzi pubblici. Sebbene possa apparire lontano dal centro città, in realtà con una bella passeggiata attraverso il parco di fronte a casa si raggiunge facilmente l'isola di Djurgarden. Siamo rimaste molto soddisfatte per questo mi sento di consigliare assolutamente la casa di Anders"

The apartment isn't far away from the city centre: you can go there by metro or buses. As we left about 5 in the morning, it is important to know that a night bus goes just outside the apartment and brings you to the central station."

Katia and Pinar checked in frequently to make sure all was well during our stay.  Katia wrote out a very thoughtful and detailed itinerary with directions/info about the apartment.

The apartment is absolutely beautiful, especially for the reasonable price.  It is comfy, clean and well decorated, located in the charming Old Town which makes it easy to get to any area in Stockholm by foot (Sodermalm a couple of minutes south, or any area north of Gamla Stan). Note that the entire area of Gamla Stan is paved with beautiful--yet bumpy/hilly--cobble-stone, so if you have rolling luggage make sure to travel around the perimeter of the small island of Gamla Stan rather than walking through it to make it much easier for you!

It was my first time in Stockholm for work and I am so glad I stayed with Johanna. First of all, she is a wonderful hostess, very friendly, kind and willing to help. She picked me up from the bus stop when I got in (really late mind you) and she made me feel at home from the first minute I walked into her place. She was also a wonderful connection for information about Stockholm, all of the things to eat, drink and visit in the city. She even drew me a map when I was running around without a phone and in desperate need of directions . She has a wealth of information about all of the trendy spots in Stockholm and was always willing to share her experience and to provide recommendations. 
The apartment is spacious enough for three people to stay, and the room I stayed in has a pull out bed, a table and a large window looking out into the street. There was some room for my things and Johanna made a big effort to accommodate my needs. The apartment is a very clean space, and we all made an effort to ensure that the apartment remained that way. 
The apartment is located in an nice location- about a 10 minute walk from the subway system, 2 minute walk from the bus and very close to both cafes and grocery stores. Johanna also had some bicycles for rent which were completely worth it! It is a great way to travel around the city.  
 If you are looking for a short term or long term room in Stockholm, Johanna’s place is great- It is a spacious room that is centrally located, and close to many restaurants and stores (check out her guide for inspiration)

I haven't explored kungsholmen area before  but now I know it's a lovely, quiet area still so close to the city with great public transport access.  Fatemeh was very fast to respond and kind to our needs. I'd recommend her flat to anyone who is looking for  serenity yet being close to the city."
"6886",6099083,34606682,2015-06-09,29543204,"Lauren","Fatemah was very accommodating and due to a last minute cancellation we gave her very short notice. She is kind and gave us tips and a clean, comfortable bed and towels. About a 20 minute walk from the central station and 40 minutes from Gamla Stan, you can take a taxi or bus much quicker but we enjoyed the walk."
"6887",6099083,35257123,2015-06-16,5164069,"Asya","This is one of the very best experiences with airbnb we've had! My husband and I have stayed together with our two small kids and couldn't have been happier with our choice. Fatemeh is such an amazing and beautiful host, from the very start she's been very responsive and attentive to our needs! We had no problem finding the apartment and Fatemeh was so kind to meet us and show us her loveliest, extremely comfortable home. 
The apartment is just everything any guest could dream of! The kitchen has all the necessary utensils and appliances you may possibly need. As we are shortly after a trip to Paris, with its typical, tiniest bathrooms, we've had a chance to compare and indulge ourselves with the wonderful, spacious bathroom in Fatemeh's apartment. Oh, and hi-speed internet was a blessing too.
However the icing on the cake is the spectacular view of the Karlberg Palace! It's absolutely fantastic!
Thank you for opening your home, Fatemeh! 
I would definitely stay there again and recommend Fatemeh as a delightful host to everyone!"

She greeted us warmly and showed us around the place. She also has a guidebook available on Air bnb which is great additional touch for a host.

Unfortunately we were let down by a previous host, but we were very happy indeed with our final choice- I think it worked out for the better!

Fatemah was very friendly to deal with throughout the whole exchange and I would highly recommend her appartment. As four adults stayed here (2 in the bedroom, 2 in the living room) it suited us perfectly, without feeling like we were living on top of each other. 

Thanks again Fatemah!"

Fatemeh was a very friendly host and tried to do everything she could to make us feel comfortable, providing lots of tips and amenities. The place is only a few minutes walking distance from the metro, which takes you into the city center within a few minutes. Right outside is a nice walkway along the river and the view is gorgeous."

L'appartamento è molto pulito e accogliente, dotato di tutti i confort. Anche la cucina è ben fornita di tutti gli utensili ed elettrodomestici. Noi eravamo 4 adulti e un bambino piccolo e siamo stati benissimo.
 Il quartiere dove si trova l'appartamento è molto bello, ideale per passeggiate lungo il canale. Dista dalla stazione centrale circa 20 min uti a piedi, ma è ben servito anche dall'autobus che ferma proprio davanti a casa ed impiega non più di 10 minuti a raggiungere il centro. La stazione della metro più vicina dista circa 10 minuti a piedi."

There is a fully equipped kitchen and a microwave. The bathroom comes with heated flooring as well. The washer/dryer is at a common area within the building and is only available at certain hours therefore it is advisable to plan ahead. There is a beautiful path for running/jogging along the river in front of her place. There is a T-bana and a Pendeltåg station nearby (it took us about 10-15 minutes walk at a slow pace) which connects to the central station, Kungsträdgården (boarding place for the boats to the archipelago) and Stockholmsmässan (convention center). The walk home can be quiet at night but the area felt safe. There is also a very good ice cream place nearby called Fryst. Fatemeh was very friendly and was always available when we had queries. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay at her place. Thank you for having us!"

Communication was always fast, accurate and comprehensive.
It was nice to meet Fatemeh for a short time, while showing us different things in the apartment.
With the bus-stop in front and some tube stations nearby (<1000m) it is also easy to reach all top spots of Stockholm really fast.
The kitchen is well equipped with everything you need, including Nespresso, Microwave, Oven, Induction stove, dishwasher - and a lot of tableware too.
For our purposes the living / eating room was also absolute sufficient, we didn´t even use the Playstation or TV.
For sure there have been enough electrical outlets for all our different chargers, and a flawlessly working WLAN.
The bedroom was nice and is equipped with a doublebed.
Also some chairs for putting the cloths are available there.
We really enjoyed our time in Stockholm and Fatemehs apartment and recommend booking it.

Obwohl Fatemeh grade aus den Staaten kam, hat sie sich ziemlich viel Zeit genommen, um uns willkommen zu heissen und uns die Wohnung, die Einrichtung und ihre persönlichen Tipps zu zeigen. Davon haben wir auch sehr Gebrauch gemacht und dies hat unseren Aufenthalt unvergesslich gemacht. 

Die Wohnung war wie beschrieben und sehr einfach zu erreichen. Nur 10 Minuten mit dem Bus vom Hauptbahnhof bis direkt vor der Haustüre. Es hat alles was es braucht und Fatemeh hat uns sogar noch schnell Netflix installiert, so dass die Abenden auch daheim unterhaltsam sind. 

Ich würde jederzeit wieder das Apartment buchen, da es neben der tollen Unterkunft auch viele Insider - Reisetipps von Fatemeh gibt. An dieser Stelle ganz herzlichen Dank für einen unvergesslichen Aufenthalt. // Tony & Martin"

It didn't bother me – it's why I love Airbnb, to be able to live in someone else's home rather than a hotel with no personality – but I could imagine that someone looking for a super neat and tidy place wouldn't enjoy it as much.

In 15 minutes walking you are in the heart of Stureplan and you have small cafes and restaurants all around the apartment. The taste and decor is very nice and everything you need for cooking also seems to be there! There was very loud construction outside the bedroom which was bothersome but this is not permanent so just make sure to ask Arnold first if its still going on. Arnold was very receptive to all communication as well. Thanks Arnold!"

We enjoyed to live there for 3 days with our 3 children : the appartment is very convenient and close to everyhting (including foodstore and restaurants).

It's right around the corner from the subway and you're in the city within just a few stops. The apartment itself is just as it looks in the photos: a simple studio, clean and well-maintained. Per was very good about getting back to me when I sent email questions. Immediate responses every time, and he was very easy-going about my arrival and departure times. I can confidently recommend his home."

I didn't hear any noise while I was there.  Also, Per was very helpful leading up to my trip.  The only thing to keep in mind is that Stockholm doesn't really get completely dark at night in the summer.  The room does have a curtain, and I was able to sleep just fine, but if you have trouble sleeping when it's not completely dark, you may want to bring a sleep mask."

"6973",6167147,39495726,2015-07-24,33563249,"Sabine","Die Wohnung ist großzügig geschnitten und optimal für eine Familie. Sie ist in einem ausgezeichneten Pflegezustand und wurde uns sehr sauber und mit sehr viel Platz in Schränken und Regalen übergeben. Aufgrund der Erdgeschoss-/Souterrain-Lage ist sie nicht ganz so hell, wie die Fotos vermuten lassen. Das Duschen in der freistehenden Badewanne erwies sich anfangs als kleine Herausforderung, wenn man das kleine Bad nicht komplett unter Wasser setzen wollte, aber mit etwas Experimentierfreudigkeit haben wir das allmählich hinbekommen. Hervorzuheben ist die ruhige Lage und der nahegelegene Mälaren mit seinen wunderschönen Badestellen, Aussichten und Spazierwegen und die Nähe zur U-Bahn, mit der man die Innenstadt in nur 20 Minuten erreicht. Auch Cafés, Restaurants und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind nicht weit. Susan ist eine sehr nette Gastgeberin, die uns schon im Vorweg mit vielen wertvollen Tipps versorgt hat."
"6974",6167147,57768672,2015-12-29,14600773,"Jeroen","On arrival we were welcomed by the host's neighbour who gave us the keys and a brief instruction.

The house is as described on the website. We liked the house which was large enough for our family (2 adults, 3 childs). Is was clean and complete. One of the two bathrooms has a shower and bath. Both have a toilet. The house is warm, the beds are very good, sufficient towels are available. Questions we had were answered quickly.

The neighbourhood is a decent, silent area. Closest underground train stations are Axelsberg and Mälarhöjden (10 min walk). In the street there is a bus stop (4 times per hour to Mälarhöjden station, takes 2 min only). From Axelsberg to Central Station takes less than half an hour when using the underground.

Two restaurants are closeby: a cheap but doable Italian restaurant (we went two times) and a more fancy and more expensive one ('Astrid', we didn't go there). 

We had a wonderful week during Christmas time. When we ever visit Stockholm again we would certainly consider this house again. Highly recommended."

Very well-equipped kitchen, very good bathrooms, beautiful balconies, comfortable beds and couches - and for the kids the wifi and the Apple-TV system was great! Nice suburban surroundings with a football pitch across the street and beautiful walking/running paths within a couple of minutes. If one considers to use a car while in Stockholm - or is happy with an extra 10 min travel time with public transport - this is a perfect choice."

The bed at 140 cm (55\") is a double bed size and not king-size so I suggest changing that in the description.  It is fine for one person, but a little narrow if you are two people used to more space.  In our case there was only one of us for most of the time.

His place is warm and inviting, and very tastefully decorated. The square really is an oasis - with birds singing in the trees, lovely benches to catch the morning sun with your cup of coffee and a superb ambiance from the restaurants spilling out into the square.

Quiet and in a nice neighborhood, but not too far from the city center - just a 5-10 min walk to metro. Patrik was very accommodating when we told him in advance that we would be checking in very late night and needed to check out in the afternoon.

De verhuurder gaf prima informatie over appartement, de buurt, check- in procedure, en algemene zaken. Hij was zelf niet aanwezig bij check-in, maar alles werkte, en was prima bereikbaar voor vragen en reageerde in enkele seconden. De buurt is lekker rustig en metro ( (hornstull) op 5min. loopafstand. Bus stopt in de straat. Over Sodermalm: prima plek! leuke restaurants, rust, en relaxte lokale bevolking. Onze aanrader voor een  (hip) drankje/hapje: hornhuset, urban deli, lasse i parken."

The apartment is located in Hornstull - a trendy party of Stockholm with some nice cafes, wine bars and parks around. It is about a 5 minute walk to the metro and a short journey into most of the sights (about 10-15 mins on the metro).

It's location is amazing in the heart of Gamla Stan with easy access to all the other neighborhoods in central Stockholm. Mats himself is very easy and quick to communicate with. I can strongly recommend booking this place!"

The joining instructions were very clear and lots of communication before we arrived to give us confidence as first time users of Airbnb. The apartment was in a perfect location in the old town Gamla Stan, right in the middle of the action but still very quiet. The description was very accurate as the apartment was very comfortable with everything you could possibly need. I would definitely recommend the apartment and Mats again."

The apartment is in top state just as listed. It was very cozy, but still big! So much space. Very comfortable.
Very good location (2 stops from the central station, pendeltåg 35 & 36 - around 5 minutes, and afterwards 2-3 minutes of walk to the apartment), quiet and nice neigbourhood.
Thanks for hosting ;)"
"7017",6206512,44206314,2015-08-24,11408635,"Roger","This was a fantastic place to stay in Stockholm - large, modern, clean and convenient for public transport ... and free street parking nearby. We didn't meet Jessica herself, but she arranged for her partner Joel to meet us. He was right on time and provided a friendly and informative introduction to the apartment. The pictures are very accurate: top floor of a 3-storey block, right next to train, tram and bus access to all of Stockholm. Despite busy roads nearby, double glazing means the apartment is quiet, though a cross-breeze on warm days can be gained by opening windows or the small balcony's door. Lots of essentials were provided and stores are relatively close. It was a very comfortable apartment and we thoroughly enjoyed staying there."

The shower is powerful and the bed is very comfortable, the location is fantastic with Just a short walk to central. The building the apartment is in, has high ceilings with amazing artwork and a marble walled entrance. It feels like a very aristocratic apartment and I would highly recommend staying here!

Also, it's a really short walk to the Nordiska Museet and Djurgården if it's sunny, which makes it superbly-located. The nearest T-station is Karlaplan which is a 5 minute walk away. Can't recommend it enough."

The apartment was furnished comfortably and was extremely stylish.  Sophie, our host has great taste. I'd love similar decor in my own home. From a location standpoint, it is a quick walk to the T-Bana (subway/trains) and close to great museums, restaurants, and other attractions.

Sophie was awesome.  We got in quite late due to issues at the airport, and she was so accommodating regardless of the very late hour. She was helpful, warm and friendly and offered advice on places to go to enjoy our time in Stockholm.  

Our whole experience felt easy.  Sophie's responses were always quick and welcoming.  I would definitely book again with Sophie and would highly recommend this AirBnB to anyone else."

The place was very cute and it couldn't have been in a better destination.  It is right beside \"Bike Sweden\" where I suggest you rent a bike immediately then head to the Djurgarden (our favourite place in all of Scandinavia).  

Overall a great experience and she was a great host.  If you get the chance stay here...you won't be disappointed!!"

The well appointed apartment has everything you could need, and Sophie was very helpful with Stockholm suggestions and flexible with check in/out. We used the kitchen easily and wifi was very reliable. Walking distance to great cultural spots, parks, the water and delicious restaurants. Would stay again and loved Stockholm."
"7031",6206549,47768931,2015-09-21,6180420,"Tom","A beautiful apartment which is in a great location on Narvavägen in Stockholm. The apartment itself is bright, airy, tastefully furnished and plenty big enough for two people (my wife and I stayed). The building it's located in is a great example of a 19th century block, the entry hallway is worth the visit alone!

Narvavägen is both close to central Stockholm, Royal Djurgården and Sodermalm. All of which are worth checking out. Grab yourself a bicycle from the rental hut literally next door to the apartment for the best way to explore the city. 

Sophie was a great host. Very communicative all the way through and made a number of efforts to ensure our stay was comfortable. Can't praise her or the apartment enough."
"7032",6206549,54214555,2015-11-16,17406029,"Bhavesh","Sophie’s place was beautiful and exactly how we had imagined it to be. The kitchen was wonderful and allowed us to relax in comfort in the morning. Sophie was really warm and inviting, offering us advice on restaurants and bars for the evening as well as being available for any help we needed whilst exploring the city. The area was brilliant, with restaurants, shops and river a short walk away we didn’t need any other transportation to get us around.  I would definitely stay with Sophie again. All the best, Bhav."
"7033",6206549,55286738,2015-11-29,6382500,"Alex","Sophie was a superb host! We didn't get to meet her but she was prompt in her responses and put in the effort to share key highlights near her place, as well as helping us to locate what we needed within her home. Her place looks better than what the pictures show. Nuff' said.
Ostermalm was beautiful in winter... Highly recommended! If you drive, be sure to check the parking signs. But honestly, all you need to do is walk. There is no real need for bicycles or a car in Stockholm if all you intend to do is to explore the city... And Sophie's place is the perfect base. Nestled 2-5 minutes from the hustle and bustle, and located within a very prestigious and safe district, there is nothing more that you can ask for. Looking forward to our return visit!"

A real home away from home in a trendy neighbourhood with many great bars, cafe's, restaurants and parks close by. It was beautifully decorated, clean and tidy, and also on the first floor making it easy to get to with lots of luggage. Kristina met us on arrival and left us with lots of helpful information. I also have to say that the bed was extremely  comfortable, one of the best beds we've ever slept in! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend Kristina's place for anyone visiting Stockholm."

She wasn't able to meet us directly when we arrived, but made arrangements for her relatives to meet us which worked out perfectly. Her flat was situated in a great location in Sodermalm and was lovely. It is near a park, groceries, and numerous popular shops, which was a definite plus. She left a brief list of local recommendations and general resources for us, which was certainly appreciated. Overall, we highly recommend Kristina's flat to anyone visiting Stockholm."

The house is actually much bigger than we previously thought and very well equipped. We used the provided bikes to visit Drottningholm and on another day the Haga and Ulrikdal castles.

On se sent chez soi. Rogers est aussi un homme charmant et accueillant. L'appartement est bien situé ! Le terminus de la ligne 1 de bus se trouve juste sur la place en bas ! Il y en a toutes les 10mn jusqu'à très tard ! A peine 5 mn à pied et vous accédez à une plage de l'archipel avec un promontoire et la nature comme paysage ! C'est très agréable pour se détendre avant de se retrouver au centre ville à 20mn de là ! Dans l'appartement il y a tout , un superbe réfrigérateur congélateur, de la couleur . Une large table , la salle est grande et aménagée à l'américaine avec les souvenirs de Roger qui vit dans une petite maison  pas loin. Ça convient aussi parfaitement pour une famille ! A l'étage où depuis l'entrée l'on accède il y a une jolie chambre pleine de charme et de souvenirs ! Je crois que nous sommes au 2ème étage et la porte d'entrée du petit immeuble est parfaitement sécurisée mais il est vrai qu'en Suède pas de grand souci sur ce plan. Bref mon fils de 23 ans et moi avons beaucoup aimé cet appartement chaleureux et personnalisé, sans oublier la propreté car nous sommes en Suède ! Merci à Rogers pour son accueil exceptionnel, spontané et simple ! Ce qui compte aussi beaucoup !"

The Stora Essingen area has a nice small-town feel with all the necessary conveniences (grocery store, pizza place, café, deli, etc.) and was a quick bus ride into the heart of Stockholm.  The bus runs about every 8 minutes and stops just across the street from the apartment, so it is very convenient.  Besides the convenient location, the apartment itself is wonderful.   The kitchen is very well appointed -- even has an espresso machine. The bedroom is quite comfortable and spacious.  We enjoyed the balcony very much.  Roger was very welcoming and accommodated every request -- an excellent host.  He provided recommendations for restaurants and places to visit that were very interesting and off the beaten path.

Roger oli supermukava tyyppi, cool. Sellainen, kenen kanssa olisi mukava lähteä parille huurteiselle. Kaikki selvitettiin perin pohjin ja Rogerin sai aina kiinni puhelimella. Asunnosta löytyi oman makuni mukaista musiikkia ja lukemista vaikka kuinka paljon. Taidamme olla samanikäisiä! Keittiö oli erinomaisen hyvin varusteltu ja yläkerrassa oli viihtyisä makuuhuone. Ympäristö oli todella rauhallinen ja ikkunan alla oli bussin päätepysäkki. Ladattavat bussikortit olivat valmiina, lataus viereisestä kioskista. Kauppa oli parin sadan metrin päässä ja pizzeria sekä nakkikioski ihan vastapäätä. Apple-TV:tä kerkisin myös räpeltää ja yläkerrassa oli toinen TV. Ja netti toimi erinomaisen hyvin.

Karle really came through for us when we realized we needed a taxi to the airport in the wee hours of dawn; even though she was pulling an all-nighter at work, she still responded immediately and had a cab come for us rapidly.

She was quick to communicate and worked to coordinate logistics of meeting up despite changes in her work schedule. She provide lots of information about the city and was fun to chat with.

"7101",6257155,47658136,2015-09-21,889932,"June","I loved staying at Karle's place! It's in a perfect location -- just steps from the T-Bana station -- in a lovely neighborhood that's close enough to everything that you can walk, but has a neighborly feel, instead of a rushed business atmosphere. It's the kind of place you'd want to live.

Karle's apartment is beautiful. The room is huge, light, and clean. The bathroom is clean and modern and the shower is hot (a big deal for me).

But, the best part was getting to know Karle, who is warm, smart, and interesting. We had time for a few conversations, but I would love to spend an afternoon just chatting with her.

This is really the best of Airbnb -- a great place to stay with a wonderful host.

Bye, Karle! Hope to be back soon."

He gave extremely accurate instructions to get to it.
Even though we did not meet he arrabnged with a neoghbour to assist anytime so was really easy and nice to be there.
The apartment fits exactly the description and the pictures. Moreover there are all kitchen appliances you may need, of course wi-fi and a multimedia TV set (with amazing music saved as Favorite, by the way) :)
Neighbourhood is very quite and safe, with a strong family taste. Is just 1 minute walking from Pendeltag (short-mid range trains) one stop ahead from City center, and barely 8-10 minutes easy walking from \"Mariatorget\" Metro station, just 2 stops away from Old Town. there's a supermarket right beneath his building. Sodermalm is trendy and charming but also quite, peacefull and nice to see around. 
Staying at Adam's apartment makes your stay in Stockholm really easy and comfortable.
I strongly recommend it !! :)"

The apartment is lovely and comfortable, everything is nicely arranged and it was clean, spacious and had everything we needed for our stay. It's in a great part of Södermalm, you can find lots of great restaurants, cafes and shops right around the corner. Getting to all the places we wanted to go was so easy as several underground stations are in short walking distance from the apartment.

Quite far outside of town but with the bikes it was manageable even if a quite hilly way... magnus was really easy to communicate with, reachable during our stay and asking if we were fine. He hided the keys for us so we could arrive whenever we wanted to, but the hiding place was a bit hard to find and complicated. 
One of the bikes had no air in the tire when we arrived so we had to fix that first (with a broken pump) before we could use the bikes to go to town which was a bit annoying and the tab in the kitchen was broken. Overall a nice stay in his flat, just wished to be closer to the city!"
"7191",6282127,44316750,2015-08-25,29375863,"Melissa","We had an enjoyable time at Magnus 's place. It is very spacious with lots of sunlight and a beautiful garden in the back. It is in a nice neighborhood where you can go for walks. 
Although is it 8 minutes from Soder, that does not include the 10 minutes walk to station from the house. Luckily, we used the bikes! However, someone cut through the bike lock and stole one of the bikes with our sandals in the basket :(
That was an odd experience considering  it is such a nice neighborhood. 

Although the apartment is spacious, the bathroom isn't. The shower is really small. So if you are 5'10 like me and used to spacious showers, it's a bit uncomfortable. 

One more thing, finding the key was a nightmare, a super funny and slightly frustrating nightmare. We had to find chairs to climb on and use our dying cellphones as flashlights to find the key, while holding a stick in the other hand to swat away spiders. (Picture 2 city girls in booties doing this, it was a sight.)

Overall, it was a pleasant stay."

He communicated really quickly and efficiently by AirBnB and helped us get from the airport to the house by leaving really useful and specific instructions. Since the apartment is a bit out of the way, Magnus lent us his bicycles which we used to get into Stockholm! It was so kind of him. We found everything that we needed at the apartment. It was quiet and comfortable and there was a store for food about 10-15 min away. I definitely recommend staying here if you don't mind the bike ride in to get to the city!"

We arrived at Skavsta Airport at 5.30pm, we took the bus to reach the city and we were there at 7.30 pm. She asked us to pick up the keys by ourselves to her friend’s place as apparently it was too late for her to wait for us in the flat, even if they both knew our arrival time at the airport. We thus lost our first evening going around the city to grab the keys. Anyway we have been extremely accommodating with her, and followed her instructions about how to find the keys (I had to enter into a private party and ask every blond girl if she was Alexandra’s friend). As it was not normal to ask us that, she was so kind to telling us to take a taxi and that she will refund us. The problem is that after our departure, she did not contact us, and when asking for the refund she said that we smoked cigarettes in the flat (which was a lie) and that she had to keep the money for compensation. Finally, she did not care taking the towels out of the washing machine which was in another building, outside the flat. We had to contact her friend again for that and we had not been able to take a shower on the first day. Overall, a very unpleasant experience with Alexandra."

After corresponding with Ann prior to the trip, she made it very easy to get our bearings Even though we missed her and her family upon our arrival, she left the keys with a 3rd party and we were able to enter her building very easy. After taking a very cool elevator up to her apartment, we entered to a very clean, bright and comfortable space. One bedroom was in a loft and the other off to the side of the main sitting area. As it was warm, it was great to be able to open the double balcony doors to let in fresh air and to have an unencumbered view of the city. It was great to come back to a space where we had some extra room without being in a hotel (not that we were there a lot!).

Thanks so much!"

Stockholm viste sig perfekt frem i disse dage med sol fra morgen til aften. Vi nød lejligheden i fulde drag, og alt fungerede perfekt. Afhentningen af nøglerne foregik helt som vi havde aftalt, og der var pinligt rent, da vi ankom. Køkkenet er super fint, funktionelt og meget skønt med opvaskemaskinen. Værten havde været så betænksom, at der lå ekstra opvaske piller til os. Badeværelset er også meget funktionelt, og specielt den skønne bruser... Værten havde stillet vaskemiddel til vaskemasinen frem, og den er meget nem at bruge. 
Sengene var helt ok, og rigtigt som værten havde beskrevet, at der kunne være lidt varmt på 1. sal. Der var varmt og vinduerne havde vi helt åbne for at skabe gennemtræk. Lejligheden fremstår meget velholdt og vi vil meget gerne anbefale lejligheden til andre der skal et smut forbi stockholm. Kvarteret er super skønt !! masser af gode resauranter lige rundt om hjørnet, samt skønne supermarkeder i gå afstand."

Ann is a  helpful host, she was flexible regarding arrival / departure time and she was quick to answer our questions in our initial email correspondence. Key collection was going quite as we had agreed.

The apartment was clean when we arrived. The kitchen is fine, functional and with a dishwasher. The bathroom is also very functional. Beds were quite ok, and true as the host had described that there could be a bit warm on the first floor. The neighborhood is very nice whit lots of good restaurant just around the corner, as well as supermarkets within walking distance.

We where three adult spending a weekend trip to Stockholm and this apartment was great for our needs. 
Overall the apartment is very well kept, Ann is a good host and we'd like to recommend this apartment to others who are planning a visit to Stockholm."

We stayed here for a long weekend, with a 4-year old and a baby. The apartment was clean, tidy and comfortable, with a well equipped kitchen and Ann had cleared two shelves in the fridge for us to use. The beds were good and there was enough space for our kids to play after a day in town, and for us to sit and relax in the evening.

The neighbourhood is really nice, with a lot of smaller cafés, bakeries and restaurants close by and a great ecologic supermarket (Paradiset) around the corner. The Metro stops two blocks south of the apartment and brings you to the Old Town and Central Station in just a few minutes. But you can easily walk to the Old Town and further.

Ann left us some tips on where to go and what to do with smaller kids, which was a great starting point.

We would definitely recommend going to Stockholm and stay here.

Her apartment is pretty big and unique in nice and charming old house. Location is very convenient in the Gamla stan with lots of good restaurants and bars nearby and good connections to other areas and sight seeing attractions by bus. We were advised by our host to park our cars to parking area next to Viking Line ferry terminal, around 1.3km away from the apartment as it was significantly cheaper, only 50kr/24h, parking on streets close to apartment is really expensive, 40kr/h. Please note, apartment is in top floor (4th or 5th floor I think) and it does not have lift, so moving in heavy luggages could be a bit painful, we were traveling light with cabin size luggages only, so it wasn't an issue for us.

All arrangement made by Chandra were very good and we were very happy about our stay there and will for sure stay an another time if this apartment is available next time we visit Stockholm :)"

The beds were comfortable and this place had more than enough room for the 4 of us. One thing to note is that it is on the top floor without an elevator (~90 steps)- that didn't occur to me from the pictures and my mom has a bad knee. We just had to limit how many times we went up and down. Check in and out was easy and Chandra was informative when we first got there. Overall, we had a wonderful stay!"

Ola was super easy to coordinate with, and easy to be around when we arrived! We were gone most of the time, but we had plenty of privacy when we were home. WiFi works best if you stand in the kitchen, but it's right next to the bedroom, so that was fine. We had trouble getting out the door once, but when we figured out you just have to pull hard and twist, we were good to go! Old houses always have tricks to learn. We were so pleased to stay here, and if we ever return to Stockholm, we will definitely try to stay here again!"

Since this is indeed an old house, there where no locks to the room and no curtains. The lock to the house does not open all the time, which made it a bit of an adventure whether I would make it in or out ( I climbed out of the window once).

The neighborhood is stunning, close to good transportation and a wonderful view. The house is old, rustic, charming with very basic amenities. We were however, surprised when we were told last-minute that Ola would not be there and there would be other visitors staying on the top floor - and that we would share a bathroom with them. Access to our bedroom was not secure because it led directly to the kitchen. This created very little privacy or sense of security. It created a strange dynamic, especially when people were cooking outside our bedroom. We were even more surprised when the people upstairs left and a new couple arrived promptly! They thought my husband was Ola and started asking us for clean sheets. This is not what we expected, nor what we \"signed up\" for. The neighborhood was great but I cannot recommend the circumstances we ended up staying in, which felt more like a youth hostel."

It is a fantastic location! The views beautiful!!The bed was comfie. WE would definetly stay there again.
It was quiet. If you have any disabilities the stairs are very step to the bathroom. 
Our only comment for improvement is that it wasn't clear when we arrived whether there were any other guess staying in the house ( (there weren't) , It was of concern as we were not able to lock our room. When we requested a key for the door that leads to the kitchen he did lock this the next day so we were then able to secure our room. The other door was able to be locked by a skeleton key but it was a bit of a challenge to close this door from the outside to lock it."

There is a small supermarket close to the flat. Public transportation is also close and goes regularly. However, most times we walked to the city center. It is about 30 minutes and a beautiful walk next to the water. 
We did not meet Gregor, but communication with him was always easy. He provided us with much information about the flat and Stockholm and answered always to all our questions fastly.

Meine zwei Freundinnen und ich haben ein paar Tage in Stockholm in Gregors Unterkunft verbracht und es war einfach wunderbar!
Die kleine Insel liegt in einer netten Gegend und selbst zu Fuß erreicht man das Zentrum in ungefähr 30 Minuten. 
Das Apartment hat alles, was man sich für einen kleinen Städtetrip wünschen kann, das Kochen war kein Problem, Handtücher und Bettwäsche waren auch vorhanden. 
Ein Supermarkt war auch in der Nähe um schnell ein paar Dinge einzukaufen. 

Gregor ist ein netter Gastgeber. Er hat alle unsere Fragen gut und schnell beantwortet und uns gute Tipps für Stockholm gegeben.

The wifi was strong and having Netflix to watch was a added extra. The apartment is situated about 15mins on the bus from the central city. The bus runs frequently and Gregor left bus cards we could use and load with money which was really handy. We definitely recommend staying here if you are in Stockholm."
"7361",6340185,40610548,2015-08-01,8002457,"Isabel","Gregor's apartment was very cozy and comfortable, even with 4 people. The bed and futon were great and we loved the location. The bus stop was close by and there were a few good restaurants walking distance on the island. Gregor also had a few bus/tram cards that we could put money on and we used those. Very handy.

Those positives being said, I did not have the chance to meet Gregor and the hosting was a disappointment. I did not know that Gregor was going to be out of town on a hiking trip during our stay. Had I known beforehand it would have cleared a few things up. Getting a hold of the keys was a pain and stressful since I was already on vacation when Gregor suggested mailing them to me. We ended up agreeing that my family and I should bus to another neighborhood from the airport with our bags to pick the keys up from his girlfriend at her work. Upon arrival to the flat, things were not ready and clean for us. Gregor had accepted another person to stay the night before without being in town to ready the room for the 4 of us that were staying. When we arrived, there were not enough clean bathroom or kitchen towels and no toilet paper. Luckily, there was enough bedding for two beds and the previous night's people had not used it all.

This felt much more like a Couchsurfing experience (and I've had better of those than this!) than something that I had paid for."

The apartment is good: comfortable bed, sofa, big TV, kitchen, balcony. Quiet and clean. With a typical Swedish rubbish bin in the building and a washing machine timetable (culture shock). The only inconvenient of the apartment is the shower that leaks, so you end up with a wet floor (easily solved with a towel). 
Big plus:  we could use the bike cards from the host. Supermarket, bus, underground and city-bikes around the corner.

The flat itself was very large and spacious and beautifully decorated. The high ceilings made it very airy and made the flat feel even larger. Furthermore you could not find a better location in Stockholm. My local friends said that it was the prime spot in Stockholm. Everything interesting and cool was within a 15 minute walk and the waterfront was just two minutes down the road.

It was a bit of a trek uphill to his place (without the bus) from the tube station, but it was relatively close and perfect for daily transportation to Stockholm or other locations. There was a grocery store beneath the apartment building as well as a Thai restaurant (we didn't get a chance to try it, but it smelled lovely) and pizza shop (which was very good) within a block or two. The apartment itself was incredibly charming and we felt right at home! The bed was made, with clean sheets, and clean towels hung in the bathroom. The kitchen was equipped with all you would need to cook at home if you didn't want to wander out (and it had a coffee pot which was what I was most excited about!). There isn't a dishwasher, but this was hardly an issue. The apartment is up two flights of stairs and there is not an elevator, so that's something to keep in mind. There is plenty of closet space in the room (though no drawers/a dresser, if that's what you're looking for), a smart television that can connect to Netflix or even cable, should you prefer. No loud neighbors or pesky traffic noise coming into the apartment, the neighborhood was lovely, and there was a wood with walking trails was very close. As previously mentioned, it's a short downhill walk from the apartment to the tube station where there is both a machine and a person from which to buy passes. It's a short 15-20 ride into Stockholm where we traveled nearly daily to enjoy the big city. It was nice to ride it back in to the quite area where the apartment is located after a busy day in the hustle and bustle of the city, so much like coming home after a long day. We only wish we would have been able to book Dag's place for more of our stay!"

Niklas is an incredibly friendly and responsive host, and his apartment is super modern and immaculate. And of course, the location is superb. It is located in one of the best neighborhoods in Stockholm. There are tons of great restaurants, cafes, shops, and some lovely parks nearby. It is only a few minute walk to reach the city center as well. The apartment itself is lacking nothing that you would need for a great stay in Stockholm. The bed is huge and so comfortable, the kitchen is fully stocked with anything you could possibly need for cooking, and there are even a washer and dryer in the apartment itself. The entire place looks recently renovated and you get the feeling that you are staying at a very posh hotel suite. Niklas left lots of closet space for us to use during our stay and it was nice being able to store our things out of the way and not have our luggage/clothes everywhere (like some other airbnb apartments we've been to). We felt very welcome at his place and I would have to say, out of the 5 airbnb Stockholm apartments we have stayed at, this was definitely our favorite. Don't hesitate to book it if it's available! Thanks again, Niklas!!"

I felt from the first minute very comfortable. The room is rather small, but perfectly adequate. It has a good ventilation and a comfortable bed.The subway is just a few steps away. At the Götgatan and around Sofo are the best shops and coffees. Sennait and Paul are a super cute couple. Very welcoming, helpful and open. Sennait is a very good cook and Paul is very chatty and informed about the current events in the city. I would have stayed longer. They are highly recommended and I would immediately re-book with them. At this point I would like to thank them, that they have made my stay in Stockholm perfectly. Best Regards Raquel"

I even left something behind, and Paul offered to mail it to me. The location is perfect, right beside the T and four stops from T Central! I would thoroughly recommend them and will be back!"

Paul and his wife Sennait (sorry if I misspelled the name) are wonderful hosts and kind, caring people. They were able to accommodate me despite a late booking. Paul gave me very good directions and even met me at the nearest subway station to help me find his place when I arrived at night. When we arrived at the apartment, I was greeted with a table full of food (which was amazing for me since I was hungry after my long train trip) and tasty tea prepared by Sennait. We had a very pleasant conversation and the hosts answered any questions I had about the area. They also offered me to use an umbrella as I went into town the next morning, which was extremely helpful as I would have gotten very wet without it. In addition, Paul checked my flight and let me know it was delayed when I was worried about making it to the airport on time.
The apartment was very clean, in a convenient location, had all the amenities one could need, a private guest room, and a comfortable bed. Highly recommend!"

The apartment is located in a trendy and lively neighborhood right at the subway and bus station which lets you explore the city conveniently and dive into Stockholm life. Still when you are back home you have complete peace and quiet. You can have a casual chat and get tips what to do in Stockholm or relax on your own.

The bathrooms are flawless and the kitchen is fully equipped with anything you need.

Mirjam's apartment is lovely, with gorgeous views, very well equipped with everything in working order, excellently located  - we especially liked the overview just around the corner and path along the water overlooking Stockholm/Gamla Stan to the north.

This is a home, and not quite as some apartment rentals that are setup specifically for rental. As such, there are many personal touches throughout, both artistic and homey. We were very comfortable.

Our only issue was at arrival when we were asked to sign a form taking liability for any and all damages, without the explicit limit set by a security deposit. We had not been told about this in advance, and had little option but to sign. But it was a surprise, and given the selection of expensive items in the house and the fact that we have young children, it was a bit worrisome. The antique pedal horse cart combined with pictures standing on the floor are certainly cute and fashionable but an outright dangerous combination with a youngster. Fortunately, it all worked out fine for us, by a mix of care and luck, but I would caution families with young children to consider this before renting."

"7589",6445699,45077542,2015-08-31,35439299,"Sara","This was a lovely, centrally located flat in a quiet neighbourhood not far from the hustle and bustle of Stockholm and very close to the city conference centre (a 10 mins walk at best). Restaurants, cafes and a co-op store in the vicinity (Konsum, 5 mins walk) were all great. The flat itself is lovely, in a quiet building, old, but recently renovated. Very accessible, being on the first floor and quite spacious for 1-2 people. The building has a lift but I only used it once when taking my suitcase up. 

The flat was very clean and comfortable, though smelling a little of the owner's cats - not recommended for anyone with an allergy to cats. 

There is a lovely terrace adjoining the bedroom, and because it was a hot week, I kept the door to the terrace open at nights with the blinds down - very safe.  The flat is well lit and ventilated and there is sufficient storage space in the bedroom if you want to unpack a few things, hangars in the cupboard and a couple of empty shelves in the fridge were very thoughtful.

Since I was reaching late at night, I asked my host to leave some coffee and a few breakfast things for me, which was wonderful as I had an early morning start. I replaced the coffee and brought my host some tea from India - just to say thank you for using their home.  

The flat has a washing machine, dishwasher, etc. but I never really had the time to use anything much - it would help to have instructions in English for some of the equipment along with all the other useful details left by the host re what to do in the vicinity. I was not sure about watering plants belonging to the host - no request left, but I was a little concerned given my long stay (7 nights) and the hot weather. 

All in all, my first experience of using Airbnb went off very well, except for the minor hiccup at the start when I got mixed up re the instructions for opening the code lock and finding the key to the flat."

Very interesting house, nostalgic and warm.

The teak furniture, the old pictures and movie posters on the wall, the numerous (and yet mostly humoristic) references to feminism, the old-fashioned feel of the place made me feel perfectly at home. The bed is very comfortable. The surroundings are amazingly quiet and green and the church clocks contributed to give the impression that one was in a village. The bus number 1 to and from town circulates smoothly and often, even on week-ends so transportation was no problem either. All in all a lovely stay (but do take groceries with you since breakfast is not provided)."

The flat is absolutely lovely. Comfy, cozy and convenient, and has everything you need. Sebastian met us outside the building, was friendly and explained everything. Throughout our stay, Sebastian messaged me a few times to make sure everything was ok, and even came round to bring a hairdryer - how nice! 
I could not have been more satisfied with my stay at this flat. It is absolutely spot on - the location, design and even price, compared to similar flats on airbnb.
A nice bonus was the Norr Mälarstrand street in the vicinity of the flat - it's a street on the shore, full of great restaurants/bars, such as Flyt and Mälarpaviljongen.
Stockholm is a beautiful city, and if you're thinking whether to go or not - do go! And I definitely recommend staying at Sebastian's flat."

When we were welcomed by the hosts we were shown around in the beautiful apartment that was well equipped and had everything we needed for a nice stay in Stockholm. With a 5min walk to the metro and shopping facilities we never lacked anything in the regard.

The appartment is very nice, everything you need is there. Two balconies, good beds and an amazing view. In two minutes you are in the middle of a huge forest surrounded by deers and musquito's. The supermarket is also very nearby and it is a 10 minute ride by metro to the centre of Stockholm and right around  the corner there is an old man selling berries in an old barn. Very cute and delicious berries. On our last day we walked for 30 minutes and arrived at a very nice lake. perfect to have a relaxed day, but also perfect to jump from cliffs and play in the water.

Die Wohnung ist herrlich sonnig - morgens auf dem Balkon konnten wir wunderbar frühstücken. Die Betten sind prima. Das Bad ist funktional. Und die Küche hat uns zum Kochen inspiriert. Der Kühlschrank war einladend gefüllt. Und Lotta hat uns fortlaufend mit Kulturtipps versorgt!
Beste Einkaufsmöglichkeiten findet man in der Metrostation  Hornstull ca. 5 min entfernt (inkl. einem guten Weinladen!)
Kleine Bars und Frühstücksbistros sind quasi vor der  Haustür.
Beim \"Loopen\" kann man Beachclubgefühle entfalten.
Und die Badestelle im Tantopark ist im Nu erreichbar.

Staying at her apartment made a wonderful visit to Stockholm even more incredible. Communication was great throughout the booking process and my stay, and she made herself available for any questions or issues by providing numerous contact numbers for herself, her boyfriend, and her father. Though I didn't get the chance to meet Sanna, she arranged for her dad to drop off and pick up the keys to the apartment to accomodate my check-in and check-out times. Sanna also wrote an in-depth guide to the apartment and building, and she and her boyfriend provided tons of recommendations for great restaurants and cafés in the area and around Stockholm, which was a huge help! The apartment itself was beautiful, featuring a great central location with a huge number of restaurants and major shopping areas within walking distance. The décor and furnishings were beautiful and the apartment was extremely tidy - and the view off the balcony was incredible and a perfect place to wind down after a busy day of sightseeing. Sanna provided space in the wardrobe for my clothes, and left a bottle of wine for my arrival (which I noticed too late, haha!). Staying in Sanna's apartment really made my trip to Stockholm truly memorable - this was my first time using AirBnB and it was a fantastic experience thanks to her. Definitely recommended!"

After a couple nights in Norway and fighting the time difference, our stay with Chandra was our first good night sleep in Europe. Chandra really makes you feel at home. Her loving mothering skills and nurturing personality really helped my daughter feel at home in a new country.  You have your own comfortable room(which does not pick up any of the sound in the other rooms), and your own very large, private bathroom. The small child and the activity of the other kids actually added to the experience because you felt like you were staying with family.  This 500 year old house is on Gamla Stan(the original island), and this makes the stay so very very cool and interesting. The entire island is like a museum! I could not imagine a better location to stay in Stockholm.  If I go back to Sweden, I will make sure we stay with Chandra again."

We felt home in is place, with a very comfortable living space, super comfy double bed, and a wonderful kitchen with induction stove.
The place was spotless, very tidy and welcoming. As for the location, you could't ask for a better neighborhood. So peaceful you feel like you gone to heaven. We actually forgot our car door opened for the whole night once (A 2015 Mercedes Viano!!) and nobody touched a thing! And the lake... what a great thing to have right there our of your door step.

In short - if you are looking for a place to stay in Stockholm - look no further!"

The neighborhood is really quiet, the lake nearby (2 mns walk) is great for kids, with a small sandy beach (and for adults too!) 
Stockholm is at half an hour drive with plenty of cool spots to visit in between. Ola is a nice host who kindly explained us all we needed to know about the house and surroundings. 
I really recommend his house for a Stockholm (and beyond) stay !

The flat is ideal more for young couple, not really suitable for 3 people or elderly (on the 2nd floor without elevator, closing the door a bit difficult). The third person slept in the living room without any curtain (daylight almost the whole day) on a really hard sofabed and not with real duvet (with a thin blanket).
The bathroom is really tiny and gets/remains wet because of inappropriate evacuation of the shower, even if we cleaned it each time.  
Kitchen is OK and big enough to have breakfast/ dinner comfortably. 
Johanna was nice, helpful and flexible, gave good indications. The only comment is that when we asked to have a hairdryer she told us to buy one instead of fixing it (I am sure there will be other guests needing it when it will be colder outside..).

Silent and smiling neighbors who show theirself very seldom. Easy acces to everywhere with bus number 54. Five min to city center with bus or with metro Red line directly go to Södermalm in 15 min. Quiet streets day and night. This is important because Stockholm is always full with events. Actually I have realised later that the location was the most calm and safer place at night too. The supermarket options are close to home. But we miss the little \"Pizza Butik Specialisten\" close to home too.  If we go back to Stockholm we know where to go, no need to look for other place.

When I arrived, he picked me up from the nearest T-bana stop and then showed me around his flat. The building is new and he had just moved in, so everything was beautiful and in perfect condition. The area is quiet and safe with lots of coffee shops and bakeries nearby, making it  easy to find a decent place for breakfast. Andy and his girlfriend also gave me great recommendations - I went to one gallery they suggested and really enjoyed it. There is a T-bana stop just one or two minutes away from the flat and it takes about ten minutes to walk to Slussen, where you can change to a different line and various busses. I think this flat is the perfect location for a trip to Stockholm, and if you don't mind walking, you can get almost everywhere in the centre of Stockholm in just about 30-45 minutes - in case it's raining, you can still take the T-bana and get everywhere even quicker."

Andy was very easy going. I told him I was hungry from my long trip and he invited me to dinner with himself and his lovely girlfriend Fanny! It was an amazing introduction to Stockholm!

As their place is central to the heart of Stockholm, it was easily accessible to all the attractions, you could choose to walk or go via the T-bana / metro.

What I call this apartment is \"a boutique hotel\". Well, Stockholm - Sweden is the 30th countries we traveled, and from the past until now, this is the best airb&b I get - number one, I mean it.
Tidy and really neat, clean and shining house decorated. Look really cozy when you enter the house.
Breakfast, man..... not only that, she even prepare a small snack and light dinner for us. From her, I see that she cares for the customer like her family guest, she does everything with caring love. I highly appreciate it.
Info about Stockholm, she has \"a library\" what you should do and should go. She really prepares it in details.
The apartment really near from many cute res and bars. Cool neighborhood surrounding area. 
Only 5minutes walk to the metro ... I think she has \"whatever you need\" for you trip.

I am not only recommend you to book with her, but by myself, I will also come back there if I have any chance to visit Stockholm again. ^_^.... Love that place.

Her place is clean, beautifully decorated and cozy. It has easy access from all of Stockholm's attractions by bus and subway. I also had a lot of fun walking around the neighborhood. It's full of cute shops and cafes. Aleksandra was friendly, helpful and always very responsive. Her local recommendations in Nytorget are worth checking out as well!

I would love to stay at Aleksandra's place again if I go back to Stockholm. Highly recommended!"

It was clean and comfortable, and had all the perfect little touches to make you feel at home (books, ample storage, a hair dryer, umbrellas, etc.). The kitchen, although small, is well equipped and we were able to prepare quite a few meals in it. However, we opted to eat out most of the time due to the apartment's proximity to delicious food - the location really cannot be beat. Nor can that stunning view. We can't recommend Aleksandra's cozy studio enough."

Everything was left ready for us and we had a fantastic time for our stay in Stockholm. The studio is comfortable, fully equipped and wonderfully clean. We had very good communications thoroughout and felt looked after. There is a good lift in the apartment block and facilities for laundry in the basement area that can be booked.

Her description of the loft and surrounding areas are very accurate, very cozy. Definitely a young and hip area. The pictures look exactly like the interior of the loft with all the essentials included and a breathtaking view of the park and church tower. Everything was clean and organized which made staying here feel so so comfortable and stress-free. 

One of the best things about this loft is its location. Literally walking distance to restaurants, shops, parks, grocery, bus stops, and train station. We even abel to watch a free contemporary dance show at the park theatre nearby, so amazing! Also, because the train station is walking distance and very easy to to use, we were able to visit and walk around all the museums and shops in Gamla Stan with ease. Truly felt like a local staying here :). Definitely hope to be staying here again in the future."

It has everything you'd need for great stay.  Prior to our arrival, Aleksandra gave us several options on how to get from the airport to her place, and then directions from the last train station.  She was at the apartment promptly as we arrived as well.  She offered great recommendations for eating and sight-seeing, and even stocked the fridge with water and juice.  The weather was great for most of our stay, so we walked everywhere--Gamla Stan, New Carnegie Brewery, Ostermalm, and Djurgarden.  If you don't want to walk, there are several buses and trains/trams close by.  There are excellent cafes and restaurants really close to the apartment, so you don't have to venture too far out if you don't want.  The view from the flat is amazing--the church is gorgeous!

We had the feeling we were living in the very nice neighborhood Sofo for the short week. Also the view was perfect! Could not have wished for more. Because we always sleep with the window open we woke up from a lot of children playing in the playground. But when you keep the window closed it is very quiet. We did not meet Aleksandra but her friend let us in and showed us around the apartment. Contact went very smoothly. A bonus was the Urban Deli just below the apartment... very nice place and handy for some last minute grocery shopping. Only downside was the 1.40m bed and the soft matras  (we are used to a lot more sleeping space on a much harder matras ;-)). Overall we loved our stay in the hart of Sofo and we would definitely recommend this place!"

She was helpful and friendly and easy to communicate with and everything in the apartment was perfect--it looks just like the photos but it's even sweeter in person. The neighborhood is delightful. There is some noise from neighboring apartments during the day and at night, so if you're very sensitive to noise, take note. For me it was no problem at all. I had a wonderful stay, and can't wait to return."

Nearby are several restaurants and on the way to the tube there are several grocery stores like Lidl, etc. The only thing we missed in the flat was a microwave, but that's only because we have a small child who drinks milk and it takes a while for heating the milk on the stove. Overall we had a very nice time in Mortens place and we can recommend staying over there."

It looks even nicer than on the pictures and the bed was very cosy. Everything is in top condition and we found fresh towels in the bathroom and food in the fridge! Communication with Morten was easy and he was a great host, giving us advice about how to get around and what to see. We can definitely recommend the place although the price is rather high (which seems to be normal for Stockholm)"

The location was perfect - right in the heart of Sodermalm so it was really easy to get around, as well as being just a few minutes walk from the metro. The apartment was just what we needed - well equipped (toiletries, towels, quick wifi and more) super clean, and looked just like the pictures. The road is quiet so we always got a good nights sleep: Plus, Morten left us food in the fridge and we had access to his Nespresso machine which was GREAT! Morten provided easy to follow directions so it was easy to find. He also provided a welcome pack with a map, leaflets and FAQs so all our questions were answered. We were 3 adults and had enough space. I would  definitely recommend. Thanks Morten!"

In fact, it was quite quick even to walk from his place to Gamla Stan! Sodermalm is a very vibrant area with lots of places to eat out or have a drink...
Morten arranged everything very well and provided us with handy information about the area. Three of us stayed at his flat, but we would have been able to accommodate four.

The apartment is very charming and you feel very at home from the moment you enter the frontdoor. The aoartment is close to metro and other public transport. A supermarked in two floors just around the corner open from 7:00 am to 11:pm. Many good restaurants. Infact one just 50 meters away, with great food and good service. We enjoyed a lot the nice terrasse, perfect for early morning breakfast. The apartment is located in a good area, quite street. We stayed easily 4 people in the apartment.

The location is very good: in the relatively quiet neighbourhood next to the city centre. All tourist spots are within 10 minutes walking distance, there are several supermarkets close by, and a tram/bus stop at the end of the street that can take you to important metro/train nodes quickly if you don't feel like walking. Our host was very responsive, both before our stay and during. 

You will enjoy a well designed appartment with a very nice music system (sonos expanded with extra hifi!), a decent kitchen, a spacious living room and a sunny balcony for a very decent price!  

Only small cons: the bathroom is a bit tight and there is no elevator to the third floor. The less-fit AirBnB'er could get some excercise here though!"

"7959",6658825,37892024,2015-07-11,9042860,"Chitra","This being our first time using airbnb, we found the overall experience pleasant. The host, Åsa, replied our queries promptly no matter how minute the problem. This was her first experience hosting on airbnb, but our visit went without a glitch. The apartment is in the central part of Södermalm. The apartment, however, is ever so quiet by the virtue of not facing a busy street. Södermalm boasts numerous good restaurants and shops. A truly trendy part of the city. The apartment is within a walking distance from the Viking Line terminal. Also, there are many attractions nearby, easily accessible by public transport. The apartment itself is lovely, featuring a room for children. Our two boys, aged 18 months and 3 years, really enjoyed playing in the room. The apartment is accessible with prams and strollers.

Åsa had stocked the fridge with some food for us to feel welcome. And we certainly did. She had also prepared towels for four of us. Also, we were free to use whatever ingredients we could find in the kitchen, including coffee. Overall a great experience, we'll surely want to stay at Åsa's should we visit Stockholm again. Very recommended!"

- Åsa's apartment look extremely cozy which made us (5  persons) feel like home.
- The balcony was great, and we spent a lot of time there in the sun.
- There were loads of Interesting (with big I) books in the library.
- Everything you would need in the kitchen.
- Åsa made sure we had clean sheets and towels to everyone.
- Fast and steady wifi.
- Very central, many interesting places to hang out, look at, or eat around the area.
- Good transport-connection a stone throw away which made it quick and easy to get to downtown.
- Easy to park outside the door if you drive by car

There are a lot of dining and shopping opportunities in the area and it is exactly a safe neighbourhood. 
I quite know Stockholm as I lived there 2 years so I visit this beautiful city at least 2 times in a year.. As long as Jonas' place is available, I dont think that I will look another place to stay for my further visits. I would strongly recommend Jonas' apartment for your stay in Stockholm."

L'appartement vient d'être refait à neuf et est très bien pour un couple. Un tout petit bémol (il en faut bien un !) sur le fait d'y venir avec un ou des enfants --> Habitués au calme et à la nuit noire, ceux qui dorment dans la canapé (qui passe d'un canapé d'angle à un lit 2 place non sans mal !) sont \"dérangés\" par la lumière permanente des éclairages (mais nous nous y sommes fait rapidement) et surtout par le bruit environnant : pas les voisins qui sont plutôt respectueux mais le soir des \"bars\" d'en bas, des livraisons et éboueurs du matin (6h en général) qui viennent vider les poubelles de verre dans un brouhaha incroyable ! De même que la porte de l'hôtel d'en face qui claque dès que quelqu'un entre ou sort. Depuis la chambre nous n'entendons quasiment rien mais du salon oui. L'immeuble étant ancien les bruits se répandent vite et la rue fait probablement caisse de résonance ! 

Cela n'enlève rien à la qualité d'accueil exceptionnelle et à la gentillesse de Katia. Et l'appartement étant idéalement situé (au milieu de tout !) nous avons pris sur nous sans problème.

Nous avons tout fait à pied avec une enfant de 4 ans et demi : Skansen, Södermalm, les rues commerçantes et bien sûr Gamla Stan. 

La ville est magnifique avec cette architecture et magique avec toutes ces lumières, les gens sont tous bilingues et incroyablement accueillant.

Je ne peux que recommander de séjourner ici quelques jours !"

From the outset he did everything to ensure I had the best time in Stockholm, responding swiftly to all my questions before (and during) my stay and even offering to get me provisions from the supermarket so I could settle in quickly. Markus gave me a warm welcome, recommendations for things to do in the city and despite the relatively late hour of my arrival, kindly showed me around the immediate neighbourhood to help me get my bearings.

The apartment itself didn't disappoint. It is spacious, really comfortable and tidy, and located in a quiet area that's yet very close to the action; the Fridhemsplan T-bana station is just around the corner with trains getting you to the centre of town in five minutes (or you can walk it in about 20) - and there are plenty of places to eat, drink and shop on Kungsholmen.

A very pleasant walk to downtown of Stockholm for people who like to walk or for those who prefer to use a public transport, metro and bus  are just behind the corner. The building, in which apartment is located, is nothing short of excellent, it is quiet and very clean with a very nice inner courtyard. The apartment was very cosy, neat and clean!!! Markus was an outstanding host, very responsive and accommodating. We are coming back for Stockholm marathon and we will definitely stay at Markus’ apartment!!"

Die Wohnung sieht genauso aus wie auf den Bildern. Wir haben uns sehr schnell wohl gefüht. Markus hat uns außerdem gute Tipps gegeben, egal ob schöne Restaurants, Bars oder andere Sehenswürdigkeiten die man sich angucken kann.  Wir würden Markus Wohnung auf jeden Fall weiter empfehlen.

The communication was fast and easy with our questions answered satisfyingly for example on advice on how to arrive from the Bromma airport and a hairdryer and an iron ready for us as we were visiting for fancy celebrations. The arrival time was flexible and they were very kind even though we were late by 45min from our original estimation. 
In general the flat was great for our purposes! Spacious for 4 people with two of us staying in the bedroom and the other 2 fit well on a big air mattress in the open living space. The kitchen was well equipped and the bathroom was big! We were very surprised how quiet the flat was as well even though it was in a popular neighborhood.
So the apartment was perfectly located in the interesting and beautiful area of Södermalm and the commute to the city was super easy and fast with the metro. The old town was an easy walking distance too. The local train station was very close as well which we used to get to our celebrations and back to the airport. 
All and all we had a very good experience and all of us were very pleased with our stay! We would highly recommend this beautiful, clean, functional, spacious apartment with a great location!"

Neighborhood has everything you need (a nice cafe is just downstairs for breakfast in the morning) and it is very safe. The house is super nice and perfect also for a long stay. One double room, one single room, a living room that can be used as extra room for other 3people with sofa bed and mattress, kitchen and 2bathrooms. Bathrooms don't have windows. Place very peaceful during the night for a nice sleep. If you want a nice place at a reasonable price this is a very good solution. I would definitely recommend Kejsa and her apartment."

Kommunikationen op til afrejsen var hurtig, tydelig og hjælpsom; og ved ankomsten var gode råd og praktisk info samt turistbrochurer tilgængelige. Så det var let og sjovt at indtage \"Södermalm\", som var en fornøjelse at opleve. Blandt andet afprøvede vi et af Kajsas favoritspisesteder, \"Barbro\" - japansk/asiatisk fusionskøkken. Super lækkert!!  Vi nød også de friskbagte kanel - og kardemommeboller fra bageren/cafeen i stueetagen. Mums! Pssst... de der kardemommeboller skal (!) prøves.
Lejligheden var ren og hyggelig - og altanen var et stort plus - den brugte vi meget. Det var desuden praktisk med to badeværelser. Det hele stemte fint overens med beskrivelserne på Airbnb/opslaget."

He had great suggestions for what we should see. The apt is centrally located and is near many shops and restaurants. The area is relatively quite at night.

Torleif is a great host - very friendly and helpful.

During warmer seasons I would have spent a lot of time at the spacious balcony with beautiful views over the city. The open fire place was such a great way to relax during cold and dark hours of the autumn. The (Website hidden by Airbnb) top of the top! Couldn't have been better. Thank you to our hosts for trusting us with your beautiful home."

Torleif also ordered CNN, BBC, and several other English language tv channels. There's always bread cheese fruit orange juice etc in the fridge when you arrive. Torleif and his unit is what Airbnb is all about!!! Doesn't get any better.  Cristian"
"8067",6720584,44341612,2015-08-25,11895322,"Francesca","Paul's house is nice,clean and comfortable.
The neighborhood is quiet but is not in the center of Stockholm; you need 15 min by train and the train station is near home (5 minutes by feet). Near the train station you can find a big market and some fast food. We didn't meet Paul but all communications with him are very easy. The house is exactly as a description"
"8068",6720584,45114366,2015-08-31,35119447,"Alejandro","The stay at Paul's apartment really went not only as good as we imagined, but it exceeded our expectations.

Paul was in constant communication with me since before the travel and he helped us providing all the information we needed to know before getting there. Paul was out of town the day we arrived, but he arranged for his friend to provide us with the keys, with a big plus of him being a chef at a very nice bar on which we were able to get a superb dinner!

The apartment is, as advised, out of the centre island but it is only few metro stations away from where everything is, it was literally just 11 minutes to arrive from center to the metro station. From there, a quick very nice 5-minute walk was more than enough to arrive to the place. The apartment was bigger than expected, with open areas all connected, very clean and with everything we needed to have. The pictures are completely accurate.

Paul left us instructions regarding the house, where to eat while in Stockholm and were to go as well which was really helpful! We didn't need any help while we were there because everything was so very well arranged.

The area where the apartment is could be the quietest place in the world, zero noise from outside or anything even if it is a suburb/residential area; sometimes we wondered if many people lived around!

I can not think of a single negative point to say about this, it has been a completely positive experience that we hope to repeat if we ever go back to Stockholm. Even if we never met face to face, thank you, Paul and Kristin! You have a really nice place there."

Das wifi funktionierte ausgezeichnet. Für mich war außerdem die Lage ideal, da ich Verwandte besucht habe, die nur wenige hundert Meter entfernt wohnen und auch in die Innenstadt gelangt man in wenigen Minuten mit der tunnelbana. Auch die Schlüsselübergabe durch einen Freund war gut organisiert. Ich kann die Unterkunft für einen Aufenthalt in Stockholm wirklich sehr empfehlen."

Allt var i perfekt ordning, och riktigt familjevänligt, t.o.m. leksaker...och grannbarn... Uppskattades då vi hade en 3-åring o en 5-åring med oss.  Strålande trädgård med hängmatta och gränsande till liten allmänning, så perfekt lekplats.  Ligger fint nära nackareservat,badplats,Hellasgården och lekplatser. Man tar sig lätt till stan med tunnelbana och ev buss till tunnelbanan om man inte vill gå de 7 minuterna.  Rekommenderas VARMT!!

We felt incredible wellcome in this family and the nice, familyfriendly home.   Even equiped with toys, neighbour playmates for the kids and beautiful lush garden.  Situated close,walking distance, to nature reserve, little beach and playgrounds. The subway takes you fast to Stockholm c.   We can really recommend this unusually nice and friendly place."

This is probably the best place I stayed at through airbnb."

We're a couple with a seven year old child and we were very comfortable on the double sofa bed and single bed in the kitchen. The whole apartment was spotless - and I notice dirt! Stefan was very welcoming too. The one thing I would note, for people who might be bothered by it (although we weren't), is that the apartment is near the fair so you can hear the sounds of people riding the attractions. All in all, a great place to stay in Stockholm!"

And the appartement is soo lovely, cosy and perfect. You know by the first step you are arriving, that Erik has the really good eyes for nice furnitures, good pictures and cosy arrangement. Perfect to relax after sight-seeing in Stockholm and to have a good coffee in the so well designed and equpiped kitchen. Also a quite and well sleep is guaranted.

He provided us with detailed instructions on how to get to his flat and some instructions for the flat. The flat looks exactly like the pictures and it is a lovely place! I loved the kitchen and the decor and the place was very clean. The bed was very comfortable with great blinds to block out the sunrise at 3 am. :)

It was also a 2 minute (if that) walk from the metro. The journey from the airport to this place was great - 20 minutes on the Arlanda express to Central Terminal and then 2 stops on the tube to his place. There are a few cafes around the corner to grab a quick bite to eat and coffee and a local grocery shop as well. His place is a quick tube ride or a nice stroll from SOHO where all the shops and places are. 

Overall this place was great and we would stay here again! Thanks Erik!"

The apartment was stylish and spacious and while we didn't do any cooking there, the kitchen was very well equipped. 
The location is excellent. Sodermalm has lots of great cafés, restaurants and bars and the apartment is a short walk from some cool vintage shops as well as the metro station. 
Our host Erik was very welcoming and we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if/when we return to Stockholm."

We were greeted by Erik who told us about the apartment and the local area. He made us feel very welcome. The apartment is great - the pictures on the website don't do justice to just how spacious this living space is. The apartment is well-situated, close to a T-bana stop for easy access around the city (although it is close to Gamla Stan and we walked home a few times which took us about 15-20mins). The apartment was pristine, sophisticated and decorated with objects and artefacts from countries around the world. The kitchen was well-equipped and it is clear from the many books in the apartment that Erik is an avid reader. Although we didn't use it, there is also access to a communal garden area. We would have no hesitation in staying at Erik's again."

We met Erik at arrival and he is a very nice host explaining all neccessary details to know about the appartment. The house is located in a quiet street but is in walking distance to the hyped SOFO district. The closer surounding has its charme and inspiring shops and cafés on its own even if its not that popular as SOFO at the moment. 
The appartment is furnished with modern classic furniture and you can find cosy places to relax and read a book. The kitchen is extraordinary well equiped. For those who enjoy to cook their on meals this is an absolute plus. As we stayed a full week this was a very important point to make our self a home.
For those interested in running: There are good running trails down to the shore of the Södra island close by.
In total: Erik's place is a real pearl in Stockholm. I can recommend it from the bottom of my heart."

All in all we had a wonderful stay here."
"8086",6727757,53185037,2015-11-06,7415778,"Francis","Erik's apartment was fantastic. Loved the location - a stone's throw from a nice selection of restaurants and comfortable cafés, two good supermarkets, and various shops and bars. It was also easy to walk to other parts of Södermalm (e.g. Götgatan, Sofo), as well as Gamla Stan. The T-Bana and bus stops are just round the corner. I would say it is the perfect base for exploring Stockholm.

The apartment was really quiet at night, as it is located on a peaceful backstreet, with the bedroom facing onto a residents' garden area. It was bright and spacious, impeccably clean, and well-equipped with a modern kitchen, impressive coffee machine, and great shower and bath. It had a nice homely feel.

Erik was a very helpful host. We exchanged messages on airbnb before I arrived, in which he gave me all the info I would need for my stay, including how to travel from the airport, the front door code, the WIFI code, where to take out the trash, etc. Erik's colleague met me at the apartment when I arrived, and I had a coffee and a nice chat with Erik a few days later in a café. When I mentioned I was interested in running, he helpfully recommended some good running trails nearby. For anyone interested in that type of thing, the circuit around Södermalm and nearby Långholmen along the water's edge are superb (and popular with other runners!)

All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better stay. Next time I'm back in Stockholm, I'll try to book Erik's flat again... if it's available!"

The apartment is a size-able, comfortable,  two bedroom with a kitchen outfitted for a chef.  The kids room has great bunk beds and all the toys for toddlers made it easy for our kids to entertain and enjoy themselves while we were not out sightseeing. Everything worked and was very easy to use.

It is a quite small apartment for two, but the furniture was so good that we felt very comfortable during our week there. Special mention to the home cinema !
The location is also great in my opinion, and very close to the subway.
One small drawback is that we could not access the building's common laundry. Thankfully we had just more than a week's worth of clean clothes :)
I definitely recommend this place for short stays as a better alternative to most hotels."

The apartment is really, really nice, even better than on the photos. It has a great style, the whole interior was made with a good taste. And here is everything you need: stove, dishwasher, large fridge, coffee machine. The bed is very comfortable. 
The house is located in a very nice and quiet area, 30 meters from water. There're a lot of small and big supermarkets nearby. The bus stop is 30 sec walk, the subway station Rådhuset (the most beautiful station in Stockholm) is 5 min walk.

Only a second key for the entrance door what have been great.  Buses and Tunnelbana are in walking distance, so are shops and restaurants. You can also have great walks along the sea.

Also Pinar, Katias friend who lives in the next building, was very forthcoming. She checked on us from time to time via SMS to see if we need anything and also organized a cheap taxi for us on our way back, to take us to the airport on a flat rate.

I can definitely recommend this appartement for anybody who is looking for a place to stay with his friends (1-3max) or couples (max 2)."

We did not personally meet Katarina but she had someone on standby in case there were any difficulties and she was easily contactable.
The apartment was amazingly situated right in the middle of the old part of Stockholm as described, and very convenient for a lot of the tourist sights. In fact we didnt take public transport at all and found it easy to walk or get a ferry.
 It was an easy 15 minute walk from the central station.

Kristina's apartment is located in the probably most attractive part of Stockholm, Södermalm. We quickly found a vast range of cosy bars, good restaurants, small bakerys, design shops, and - important for young families - many, many good playgrounds. Also, we had easy access to all major sights downtown - museums, ferries to the archipelago, etc. were within walking distance for our kids (5 & 7). Also, the subway is only a few blocks away. The street itself is quiet, so even though there's a nice nightlife scene around the corner, we were not bothered at all.

The apartment itself is very well-structured with a highly functional kitchen with all necessities. There's a large, comfortable bedroom, a wide living room with TV, Playstation, etc., and a children's room with a very nice bunk bed (full size!). The bathroom holds a tub and has floor heating. 
All rooms are tastefully decorated in Scandinavian design style, still being very practical for a family of four. On warm summernights, there's a balcony for enjoying a glass of wine when the kids are sleeping... 

Kristina was present at our arrival and ensured that everything was functional. We had no trouble or need for contacting her during our stay, as everything was very easy to find out. To the joy of our kids, the children's room held a lot of toys (LEGO!), which they were allowed to use.

All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay at Åsögatan and would gladly return in future holidays.

Two notes: There's a small LEGO store with a nice selection a Brännkyrkagatan 56. And remember to buy your wine before the liqour store (Systembolaget) closes at 19:00."

The flat has great transport connections and is located in a very nice neighbourhood with plenty of lovely cafes and restaurants. Kristina was very helpful and kind.

How lucky I was to find Safra's lovely apartment in a brand new area for me to explore.  This neighborhood has it all!  It's just down the hill a bit from the  Monteliusvägen walkway and the special Ivar Los Park.  The old wooden houses nearby are so charming and lovely to walk around in the mornings & evenings.  The views from this part of Södermalm are enchanting.  There are  easily 4 bus lines within a 5 min walk and a metro stop as well.    the apartment itself felt big & roomy.  I loved the desk in front of the bay window in the master bedroom.  The entire space is warm, inviting, and clean.  Safra got back to me right away and communication was easy.

The communication was good and Martin welcomed us with snacks and coffee after our long car ride, much appreciated. The location of the house is great. Safe neighbourhood, huge grocery store and subway within 5 min walk and you are quickly in town. We didn't bring many toys for our 2,5 year old, but he was allowed to play with the toys in the house and was very happy. He also enjoyed the garden with the trampoline. 
The house itself is very nice too and has all the amenities you need. However, they have an ant problem and there were quite some ants in the kitchen. Also, both  bathroom and kitchen could have been cleaner to our taste."

our sons enjoyed the trampoline and the kids' toys around the house, and each had his own comfortable corner. 
communication was fine, we arrived very late at night and the beds were ready - very nice touch.
Location was perfect for us, short metro ride to the old city, as well as easy access to the motorways (we had our own transportation). not far (by car) was a wonderful municipality pool (FARSTA) which was great and very cheap.
bottom line - we would happily return! recommended."

Linda is simply the perfect Airbnb host because she thought about everything in order to make us feel as comfortable as possible. The apartment contains absolutely everything you can possibly think of. 
Whenever we had a question, doubt or whatsoever, we could always talk to Linda and she answered us within a few minutes.

He's one of the reasons why my two friends and myself enjoyed a great stay in Stockholm for 6 nights. The appartement was clear and nice, very near to two T-stations which take you to the city in a few minutes and still in a quiet neighbourhood. A supermarket is about a 10-min walk away at the Globen Center and it's also open on sundays, which is really nice ;). The pictures look like it is.

The flat was very cosy and in fact had enough space for four people as well. There were more utilities than we had thought or than usual, like  big shower towels, soap, toothpaste, which was very kind of him. I would definitely recommend him since the location is very close to the centre of Stockholm via tube. Surprisingly, the flat is also very close to the Globe Arena which would be perfect for younger people that need a place to stay after a concert for example. What is more, the location is reliable even at night/evening hours. My friends and I also got to talk to one of Robin's neighbours who was very friendly towards us. Although it was the first time I had ever been out like that on my own, we found the experience fun and  very helpful for further times."

He replied quickly, provided us with all the information we needed and offered directions from the central station to the apartment (including a map of the route from the closest metro station). Finding the apartment and checking in was very easy. Even though Robin couldn't be there to greet us personally, he made arrangements for us to get the keys. The apartment was exactly as in the pictures. Clean and perfect for two (bed, sofa, and possibility to use a fold-out bed). Kitchen and bathroom were fine. Also nice: the balcony.

It is exactly as in the photos. The little terrace outside is wonderful. A pity that because the bad weather we could use it only one day..! The zone is good connected with the city center with many busses, and you have quite near a big supermarket and the System Bolaget. I really recommend this apartment.

The apt was conveniently located and well connected to Downtown and Central Station (bus stop #69 only 3 min. walk from the apt).

Robert was the perfect host, recommending places for us to go and answering all our questions before our arrival and was in close contact with us during our stay, making sure we had everything we needed.

The bed is fantastic with lots of pillows, and the kitchen is very well equiped with everything new, looking barelly used.
The location is pristine and the skyline in the private terrace during the night fall is awesome. Very close to the metro line and few steps to a lake that we experienced a nice and pleasant trail close to the water, that we could enjoy listening to birds, seeing boatings crossing by and it was delicious fun to be collecting raspberries along the bushes on the way.
If you want to visit Stockholm and be few minutes from the nature, this is the right place to stay.
And one of the most important thing for us. We like to interact and we was luky to have a chance to dinner with Mansour and Julia. We have had a really good time, and we are sure that they are one of the most kind and lovely persons that we have ever met. Thanks a lot!

The apartment is a short walk from Varberg metro station and it is a quick journey into central Stockholm. The location is perfect for those that want to stay in a quiet area but want to easily access to city. The metro runs very late and so you can go on a night out and still get back.

Die Räumlichkeiten waren für uns einfach perfekt und die Kinder hatten keine Langeweile, da viele Spielsachen und Bücher vorhanden waren. Für unsere Unternehmungen (Vasa-Museum, Skansen, Junibacken...) war die Wohnung sehr günstig gelegen. Ein Coop und ein Schnellimbiss waren nur wenige Meter entfernt. Der Kontakt mit Louise im Vorfeld war sehr nett und hilfreich. Die Übergabe der Wohnung lief unkompliziert und zuverlässig ab. Wir würden einen Aufenthalt bei Louise uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen."

Die Ausstattung ist sehr gut, es ist wirklich alles vorhanden was man braucht und noch vieles mehr und es ist alles in einem sehr guten Zustand. Alles ist sehr geschmackvoll und liebenswert vorbereitet. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr ruhig und angenehm. Wir nutzten das Apartment als Familie zu dritt für eine Woche. Auch vier Personen könnten zwar genügend Raum finden, aber wir denken, dass das Apartment für drei Personen optimal ist. 

Ester ist außerordentlich hilfsbereit und bemüht und hatte uns bereits im Vorfeld viele hilfreiche Informationen rund um das Apartment und für den Aufenthalt in Stockholm generell geben können. Wir haben uns immer sehr gut aufgehoben gefühlt und können sowohl das Apartment, als auch die Gastgeberin zu 100% empfehlen.

Das Apartment ist etwa 5-7 Minuten zu Fuß von der U-Bahn entfernt. Ebenso ist eine Bushaltestelle des 'Flybussarna' in maximal 10 Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar (Shuttle Bus vom/zum Flughafen). In der unmittelbaren Umgebung befinden sich kleinere Lebensmittelgeschäfte und in der Nähe finden sich auch Restaurants, insbesondere ein sehr gutes Indisches Restaurant, das uns Ester empfohlen hatte (vielen Dank Ester!).
Die Hauptsehenswürdigkeiten und wesentlichen Hot Spots  in Stockholm sind problemlos mit der U-Bahn oder auch mit Fahrrädern zu erreichen (Stationen der 'city-bikes' sind ebenfalls in der Nähe). Man kann so alles in sehr kurzer Zeit erreichen. Auch zu Fuß wäre das Zentrum erreichbar, jedoch muss man dafür mindestens 30-45 Minuten rechnen. Allerdings geht der Weg wunderschön am Meer entlang, so dass auch dies eine grundsätzliche Alternative ist. Überhaupt ist das Meer in nur 5 Minuten vom Apartment zu erreichen, ebenso eine ruhige Insel für kleine Spaziergänge. 
Zusammenfassend waren wir rundum sehr zufrieden und können das Apartment wirklich sehr empfehlen. Wir haben uns wie zu Hause gefühlt.

Vielen Danke an Ester"

Det er et dejligt hus, tæt på bus og dejlige omgivelser - det var perfekt til vores familie med 4 voksne og 2 småbørn. Mats og Margareta er et herligt værtspar, og vi følte os meget velkomne og hjemme i deres hjem. Det er vigtigt for os, at værter har et afslappet forhold til gæster, fordi vi rejser med to små børn, som godt kan rode og være lidt over det hele - og det tog de bare så fint. De stod også til rådighed for os, når vi havde spørgsmål i løbet af weekenden - det var ekstra skønt og gjorde os trygge ved at være der. Vi kan varmt anbefale Mats og Margaretas hjem til andre rejsende - vi vil overveje selv at gøre brug af muligheden igen, da vi har familie i Stockholm, så vi kommer der jævnligt :) Tak for en dejlig, tryg og problemfri weekend i Sköndal."

When we arrived in Sweden Richard met us at the Tunnelbana station and walked us to the apartment, just a couple of minutes. This was very nice and accomodating. He showed us around the apartment and told us about where the shops were and other useful information. There was a bus in front of the apartment but we preferred to walk into town and back. Especially crossing the bridge we loved a lot. Just across the bridge is a glutenfree bakery and almost next to it a complete vegan shop(everything there was gluten and dairy free) which for us was heaven! The apartment was nice and had all the things, like an oven, a bath, a huge fridge/freezer, a induction cooker, a coffeemaker (Website hidden by Airbnb) make your stay very pleasant. The bed arrangements for me and my daughter were more than enough. 
Internet worked fine, but things like Netlfix didn't work for us. Richard told us about the Apple-tv box, but that didn't work like for Netflix for us. We could log in, but it would not start the programs we chose. It is probably a Netflix thing.."

Furthermore you can go and explorer the different vintage stores (there is a beautiful one next to Lilianes apartment). If you like to walk, you can walk to the old center in about 30min. From there you can continue walking to Sofo. Buy yourself an Access card as well. It allows you to easily take the bus, train, subway and even the ferry. So easy to leave the city and enjoy the nature of the archipelago, the national park, etc. We definitely recommend to stay at Liliane's place when visiting Stockholm!"

The room itself was clean and in great shape, and my communication with Elly was flawless. She was just a text away if I needed anything. I highly recommend staying here.

The home itself is absolutely wonderful with a spacious master bedroom and a great kid's room for our two kids.  The living room was huge and welcoming and the entire home was as stylish as can be.
The location was about 50 feet from the nearest metro stop which proved to be convenient beyond measure and restaurants (& pubs) galore dotted the block.
I'd stay here in a heartbeat when the opportunity presents itself in the future. 
The exchange of keys and general instructions went well and Daniela's warmth and ease in communications was welcomed to top it all off."

We arrived after midnight and she was very accommodating to let us check in so late. Birgitta’s place was lovely. Large, clean, centrally located and very warm (you need this in Sweden in winter!). The apartment is very large with high ceilings and a really cool kitchen. The only downside was that the beds were quite hard, however for us it was a minor detail in an otherwise lovely stay for two nights. Location wise it is an easy walk into the centre of town and there are a number of delicious restaurants and bakeries a short walk away. There are also two supermarkets in easy walking distance from the apartment. We would happily stay with Birgitta again!"

"8508",7048931,37623051,2015-07-08,4934271,"Fiona","This place is an undiscovered gem! I was the first AirBnB person to stay in the apartment and I have not stayed in a nicer place in 3 months of travelling. Johan and Pegah are so lovely, made me feel very welcome when I arrived, had a map ready for me and told me about things I might want to see. 
The photos do not do the place justice, the place is very bright, light, airy and spacious. The rooms are very spacious and there are 3 main rooms, a separate dining/ lounge, a kitchen/ dining and a very big bedroom. There is also a big foyer. The bathroom is small but very functional.
The apartment is in one of the most amazing spots in Sodermalm, it is on the 4th floor, has a lift for luggage, and looks into a hidden away little park that the residents go to to relax, play with their kids etc. The metro is very close.  It is a very special apartment and I predict that Johan and Pegah will be much sought after once word gets out. I was the first to stay there so feel very lucky that I did. 
One note of caution, the fabulous double windows in every room can fly around if not fixed properly. I found this out to my sorrow when I came home and found a broken pot plant and an ornament, so take care with the windows. I can't recommend this apartment more highly, a really great place to stay.

Johan was meeting me at the apartment. I arrived quire early in the morning but it was still very easy to arrange the check-in. We exchanged messages already before I arrived, so I had the info I needed about the apartment well in advance. He was also very fast in responding to my questions.

The apartment was gorgeous and spacious, with an absolutely unbearable view and a perfect location; the neighborhood itself was a lot of fun, but it was also perfectly central to all the major attractions in Stockholm, and super accessible by metro. The place itself was clean, thoughtfully laid out, and full of natural light. We both joked that we'd buy the place if we could!

Une cuisine super équipée et un joli jardin, tout cela à 20 minutes du centre de Stockholm, très bien desservi par le bus numéro 1 (que nous vous conseillons fortement, passage très fréquent, toutes les 10 minutes). Nous avons été parfaitement accueillis et renseignés par nos hôtes polyglottes, mercis spéciaux à Ana, Ola et bien sûr Robin (mais aussi une autre invitée Maria) qui nous ont bien renseignés et ont fait le maximum pour comprendre notre anglais fort pauvre, comme la majorité des français.

A nice house with a large bedroom for the parent (s)  and a small room for the child. A fully equipped kitchen and a lovely garden , all just 20 minutes from central Stockholm , well served by bus number 1 (which we strongly recommend , very common way, every 10 minutes). We were well received by our knowledgeable and multilingual hosts, special thanks to Ola, Ana and of course Robin (but also other invited Maria) who have we have done the best to understand our very poor English , as the majority the French.

For all this, we highly recommend this accommodation.

We got all the informations we needed and felt most welcome in the house. Unfortunately, we had little time to extend interesting talks with people in the house. Second, we liked the house very much. If you like this kind of elder villas, this is a place you would like to live (not only for some days). Finally, the location on the island of Stora Essinge is in a living area but well connected to the city (bus line and metro). For those who like to walk (or run), the City Hall is 90 min walk, e.g. through Lilla Essinge and along the waterfront of Kungsholmen. Generally, walking/running the bridges and along the waterfronts gives you some great views outside the standard programme."

The best with this living, was the busses that came close enough, and nice neighborhood. Easy coming and leaving. I hardly saw my host, except for the moment he came home and greeted us. Looked like a sweet young guy. I didn't get to know him, as our stay was short.
But.. that's where the good things are, unfortunately. First I tried to contact him, several times the day before. I didn't know what time we could come, if he was there when we arrived. The same morning, he finally responded and said he was at work, but we could still enter the house, with the code he gave us. That was fine. 
The apartment was in third floor, no elevator. We had two heavy bags to carry, so it was uncomfortable. 
The next thing that happened was that we entered, and had a huge, terrible chock and disappointment!  It was, untidy, dirty and frankly, disgusting. We couldn't use the shower, and toilet and surroundings where so filthy that we, felt so bad to force ourselves to use it. Nothing looked like we were expected, and frankly we (me and my 8 yr old) wanted to run away. There was no guidance in, where to sleep or, wi-fi code. We couldn't contact him, before we left our bags and found an internet cafe. I also tried to contact airbnb for advice, as I didn't want to sleep there, but failed. Next I asked, the host if refund was still possible? He was then on his way home, and promised to talk about it. We entered the house, and finally he showed us where to sleep. Before he came home,  we couldn't rest anywhere. I decided to stay, because we wouldn't stay many hours more. Now, I sat on the bed, and seemingly the mattress was too big, for the bed and I fell down with mattress and all, on the floor :( . Ouch! Also the pillow looked dirty, and no cover on them.  The garbage bin was full etc. I felt a bit suspicious about using the bed, as nobody minded about cleaningness. Myself couldn't sleep, but my kid slept. We were very relieved when this experience was behind us.

I am so sorry to say all this, but he may of course improve himself when he will be aware of this. I hope this will rather help him, to be a better host."

We had a lovely time at Josefina's, in her subtly vintage-decorated flat. The flat is spacious and very functional, and was impeccably manicured when we arrived.
It is located in one of the best area of Stockholm, to my mind. Though truly in the city center, we enjoyed its quietness, as well as the little supermarket down the street. We also enjoyed the fact that the flat was \"baby-friendly\", easy to live with a child and the elevator to reach it.
Communication with Josefina was perfectly smooth, before and during our stay.

We did not meet Josefina but she absolutely made sure that we did not had any trouble getting in the apartment and left some milk for our morning coffee, very thoughtful.  We fell in love with the apartment, wonderfully decorated with a mix of modern and old. A inviting place which is hard to leave in the morning and one is eager to come back to in the evening. Apart from being the wonderful space, the apartment is very functional, equipped with all amenities that one would need from the 50's toaster to dishwasher, from phonogram to apple TV, you get the idea. :) The neighbourhood is really quiet and everything is nearby; grocery store, bus stop, metro, bikes, park, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. We would absolutely love to go back to Josefina's apartment and would highly recommend anyone looking for a short/ long stay in Stockholm."

It's located nearby water in Hornstull area where you can find bars, cafes and shops. Also you have an adorable flea market on Week end. Finally just get out from the building and enjoy your running along water and Långholmem island. 
The metro is just five minutes by walk, 
The contact with Lie was easy all the time and she would reply to all your request.

The apartment is lovely - looked just as per the photos. Light, modern and in a great location, we loved Sodermalm and the coffee place Lie recommended. Fabulous fika! 

Lie left out travel cards for us to top up - which was great. After walking the majority of Stockholm on our first day, the metro was a relief on the second!

We immediately fell in love with their beautiful garden, well collected furniture, books, self consciousness on food and waste and above all their incredible kindness and hospitality! Together with our youngsters (1 and 3 yrs) we spend hours of berry picking, playing with the swing and a sandbox in a hidden playground behind the house. They lend us their bikes and went cycling to Stockholm only 20 minutes or so, to go to Junibacken (highly recommended). This is what Air BnB is about: staying in a home like home, getting a sense of what it's like to live there and meeting new people you're hoping to see again one day ;-)"

The location was very central and the subway station was 5 min away. The only thing that is negative is that we were only able to stay one night.

They were super helpful in getting in touch and asking how many beds we would like and if we wanted anything stocked in the fridge for breakfast. Very quick to respond to any questions and gave us advice on how to get to their home from the airport and how to get into the city centre.

They made it incredibly easy to use everything in the house by leaving written instructions.

View was lovely, jacuzzi was relaxing, my group of friends had a great time!

The house is very charming and spacious. You get your own privacy while living with Robin and his roomates. They all come from different countries and that makes this house multi cultural and rich. It is out of the city center but it's very easy and convenient to visit Stockholm from there since you can find a bus which brings you in the center in 15 min.

 It is maybe a 10 minute walk to the centre. If you don't like walking; the subway is 5 minutes away.

Also very close to top restaurants, trendy bars, and city center. Safe area. The beds were very comfortable, and all linens were clean and fresh.

I didn't meet her and she didn't seem as keen to talk as I've experienced with other hosts, but that could be a good thing depending on what you like. She was very helpful when I asked for recommendations and info and always available.  

Overall the studio was in an \"ok\" condition. I don't think it was cleaned before I arrived, at least not to my standards, and in the kitchen, no kettle, and the pans and pots were extremely old and damaged. But if you just want a place to crush the night and won't be using kitchen or making tea, then it's perfect. 

 The neighbourhood  was very nice and safe. Plenty of nice restaurants around the area and Scandinavian design shops. I was later on told by a local that it is the most trendy area right now and housing prices are high around the neighbourhood. 

Panthea didn't have anyone staying the day I left and she was happy to let me stay until 1pm so I didn't have to walk around the city with my luggage.

It was clean and tidy - Only thing it did not have, was a washing machine or access to one - This may be important if one is staying for more than four/five days, I think. 

The host Viktor was very nice and was attentive - all emails answered/replied to, promptly.  So would give four gold stars  out of five.  Would love to stay there again.

We were a family of four (2 adults, 2 kids) staying there. The location was great as there was an amazing playground for the little ones less than a two-minute walk out the back. A supermarket was a half-block away as well and the kitchen was well-stocked for cooking. Cafes and restaurants were slightly further away.

There's loads to do in sodermalm with nice friendly locals and a chilled out vibe."

He was super accommodating with my far from ideal check-in and check-out times and gave wonderful recommendations and tips about the neighborhood (which I highly recommend in general). It seems like he has done some redecorating recently, because the apartment didn't look exactly like it did in the pictures. However, it is still modern, clean, and comfortable, and I was not disappointed in the least. The location is great - it is a short walk to the shopping areas of Södermalm as well as Gamla Stan. The view over the city from Mariaberg is breathtaking at any time of day or night! I had a wonderful few days in Stockholm, and Aria and his apartment played a large role in them."

Property is in a great location near to a park, various subway stations and panoramic views of the city.  The apartment was clean although some of the furnishings had been changed/modified versus the photos which we were informed about prior to check in, these differences were not significant.

I really liked the central location of the apartment and the quiet area. Fanny is very friendly, she really respects your privacy and most of the time, I had the apartment for myself. The room is pretty big and has a flat screen TV.

What I think could be improved is the cleanliness in the bathroom. I am also used to have fresh sheets on the bed, when I check-in. In the room I missed some convenient furniture to hang up my clothes. Be sure to check with Ulrika or Fanny who is going to be your host. The profile picture of Ulrika, which is the mother of Fanny, is misleading in my opinion, because at the end, Fanny was my host. I would have expected more transparency concerning the information about my host.

The apartment has an upside potential, if the host cares about cleaning and tidying up from time to time."

Everything was clean, the towels very soft and she made some space in the fridge for own food. While she was working, her lovely son stayed at home to help in any case.
You should be very open minded and like a simple lodging. The flat is a bit badly soundproofed, so you can hear the computergames, but it was to no time a problem for us. Fanny made everything to let us feel comfortable, gave us good tipps for fine restaurants and it was easy to communicate.

They are very friendly and accommodating hosts, and Hillary the majestic cat surely has to be the reigning queen of all Scandinavian catkind. The room is large, tastefully decorated and tidy, with comfortable beds, a table large enough to eat at, and ample storage space for clothes. The apartment is located in a lovely and quiet district of the city, within walking distance of the city center, and with multiple shops and parks nearby."

Die Gastgeber sind freundlich, zuverlässig und unkompliziert und nehmen sich auch gerne Zeit um eventuelle Fragen zu beantworten und Tipps für den Stockholmurlaub zu geben. 

Das Zimmer und der Rest der Wohnung sind sauber, gemütlich und liebevoll eingerichtet. Es liegen Handtücher bereit und Zara und Mikael haben sogar Platz im Kühlschrank für uns gemacht. Auch die Benutzung von alltäglichen Kleinigkeiten wie Kaffee, Geschirr und einem Fön war überhaupt kein Problem.  

Die Lage der Wohnung ist praktisch zentru (Hidden by Airbnb) ah und U-Bahn, Supermärkte, Bäckereien, Restaurants, Bars und Pubs sind in unmittelbarer Nähe. Da die Wohnung in einer Seitengasse liegt, ist es Nachts trotzdem angenehm ruhig. 

Eine tolle Unterkunft in der man sich wohl fühlt!"

Her cat was the cutest roommate of all - we miss her already...
The apartment was easy to find and well located, just a short metro ride from the city centre or a pleasant walk."

In addition to the conversations we had with her staff, we also shared many thoughts with her in the spacious kitchen, and listened carefully to what she had to say about things.

The room was perfectly clean,big enough for us and included a desk as well as some arrangement to store some clothes. They even arranged a pitcher with water for us.
The shared bathroom was clean as well, and we had no conflicts during the morning routine. 
The location was excellent, next to a tube station (about 2 Min walk) and directly opposite a bakery with good kanelbullar. Also a supermarket which is open all day from 7 to 23 is nearby.
We did not spent much time at the flat, so we had not that much opportunity to talk, but when we did we had good conversations. All in all they were very friendly and open minded, including the lovely cat Hillary.
We can absolutely recommend staying at this place."

It would work well for two adults and two children. A third child would need two to share the larger lower bunk-bed. The location is reasonably quiet in a residential area with play facilities for younger children close at hand. Two small neighbourhood stores within two minutes walk, the metro is about five minutes away and you can walk to the old town in about 20 minutes. Our host was away but readily contactable by phone and someone turned up within ten minutes of us arriving to let us into the apartment."

The place itself is nice and there is everything you need (bathroom, kitchen). It is a bit far from the city center, but that's perfectly ok for the price. There is just one thing that could have been a bit better - the room could have been cleaner, as there was some dust on the floor and under the bed. But no biggie. I can honestly recommend both Yusuf and his place."

On my first night in Stockholm he invited me to catch a movie with him in the city and we also grabbed a bite to eat. Yusuf acted as my unofficial guide and made some great suggestions about places to visit. The room and his apartment are accurately described and I think that most guests will feel comfortable and satisfied with this choice. The area of Tensta where the apartment is located is a multi-cutural enclave and will offer visitors (who are open to experiencing something outside of the tourist bubble) a different insight into the city."

The area of Hornstull is very lively and offers everything you need: restaurants, bars, a park, a beach, grocery stores, several gyms etc. It is also extremely well connected as a metro stop is just outside the house.
In the apartment I had everything I needed as well and much more. The kitchen and bathroom are very small but still convenient to use. Erik left his Xbox in the apartment, so even boring hours could easily be overcome.
I had to get used to sleeping in the loft bed but as it is super comfortable that wasn't very hard. Even though some neighbors seem to really enjoy loud music, it was always super quiet at night as the house is in the second row.
Erik made sure that I understood the \"Swedish way\" of doing laundry and separating trash etc. which is a bit strange at first. Overall, I was very happy with the apartment and can recommend this place especially (but not only) for students who like to go out and live in a trendy neighborhood of Stockholm."

On my request Karin had very kindly split the huge double bed into two singles so I didn't have to share a bed or even a room with my mum.  Karin gave us a very warm welcome to her flat, was full of advice and tips and then left us to our own devices. There was no need to contact her during our stay but I felt very confident I could do if any problems arose.  The location is absolutely ideal, close to the metro and by far the coolest of the city's neighborhoods. Sodermalm is brimming with great restaurants and bars. My only advice is to book those great restaurants well in advance, probably online before you leave. A couple of restaurants namely 'Nook' and 'Nytorget 6' had brilliant vibes and menus but we just couldn't get in."

The photo's don't do it justice actually. Area's perfect if you want to be in the cooler part of town and Jonas told us loads of good places to go and even hooked us up with his mate who took us out on the town.

The area (Midsommerkransen where the apartment is located) is perfect especially for families with kids. I have never seen such a peaceful and lovely place so central in a big city before, and I have lived in a lot of big cities around the world. The neighbourhood has a mild bohemian / cultural vibe too it, and the area has a couple of nice restaurant, which we went to. It's a special place!

 I can recommend Svenska hamburgerköket which is only 150 meters from the apartment for a really great burger! One of the best in Stockholm (also heard that from swedes!)

Ingela is very nice, kind and was very welcoming. I was very lucky to pick up her place and will do again next time I am visiting the city. If you have to pick - don't hesitate to choose Ingela and her place."

Il est très proche des transports en commun et très facile à retrouvé. Concernant la localisation, l'appartement est proche des quartiers vivants ( restaurant, bar ,  magasin, mais aussi proche d'un grand parc), il est donc possible de se balader à pied depuis cet appartement.
Tout était a disposition (serviette, drap )
Sanna a été une hôte parfaite malgré notre retard dû à l'avion, elle nous a parfaitement accueillie et ceci même en béquille.

The apartment was very stylish, clean, and perfect size for 1 or 2 people.  It is close to Hornstull/Tanto beach, one of my fav chill spots in Stockholm, which also plays host to the street food market on Sunday morning. 

I love Sodermalm, I always choose to stay on this island. I’ll bookmark Sanna’s place, hopefully she will have me back again. 

On the host: Sanna was friendly, very flexible, and quick with all the comms.

The appartment is in a very central location: Close to the underground and within walking distance from SOFO which is a neighbourhood with lots of cafe's and interesting little shops. 
The only thing that is missing to make the appartment perfect, is a sofa or a couple of comfortable chairs to relax in.
Also   if you sleep with open windows, you must expect some noise from the street in the morning,

She provided detailed and easy instructions of finding the keys. The place is as described in the listing except for the washer that was noted in the listing. There is a laundry room in the basement of the place, not in the apartment itself. The heater does not work. Stina was very responsive to our questions once checked in. We accidentally drank some of her liquor stored in the kitchen, which we thought was for guests but not so we had to pay her back. So we would suggest to make that clear in the listing. Other than that, our stay was rather pleasant."

Even though we never met the hosts, they made us feel very welcome right from the start, by leaving a welcome gift for us and communicating in friendly and timely way. They also made sure that we had everything we needed for travelling with our 4 month old baby, which made our trip a breeze.

Når vi kom til leiligheten ventet en flaske champagne og en velkomsthilsen. Leiligheten var helt strøken, og alt var klart for at vi skulle ha et flott opphold. 

Jeg kan absolutt anbefale leiligheten til andre.

Everything we needed was available, fresh and clean, with large supermarket around the corner and bakery across the road. While the basement laundry meant I could freshen up all our clothes quickly in one evening. Extra guests were easily accommodated for a couple of nights on the pull out sofa bed, and when they were gone this extra bed gave me a chance to sleep apart from my child. I found Susann to be a very understanding host, providing toys for my child to use and ensuring we knew the children's TV channel. This apartment was an easy walk from the airport bus stop at St. Eriks Plan, and very handy to the buses and underground trains at Odenplan. Living right next door meant that Susann could quickly deal with any issues or questions I had, which helped to make this a wonderful experience for me traveling as a sole parent. This compact apartment provided us with a peaceful and versatile home for our stay in Stockholm, and I certainly recommend it to other travelers and families."

Joe was very communicative, and although we never met, the arrangements for checking in were perfect. He was quick to respond re the booking, and totally responsive with any questions I had.

The apartment is just as described, but possibly even better. Why? because, even if it is a studio apartment (albeit with a real kitchen and real separate dining area), it has real character and atmosphere. The apartment has recently had a partial renovation, although the floor in the kitchen and hall is original (and good job too... looks wonderful).

I loved the area. Not a great night life, but you are so near the centre of town, literally 2 minutes walk to the underground / subway, and the street is virtually vehicle-less, so it's very quiet.

It was also super handy to a local grocery store, and only 20 mins to get from the door to the centre of town on the train. Would highly recommend staying here, unfortunately, I think this place might not be available any longer."

Was not disappointed. 

One thing not emphasized enough on the listing page is how WONDERFUL the area is surrounding the unit. Despite the very central location (a HUGE plus - only 5 minute walk to the subway, only 10 minute ride to the city center with very easy and quick access to other areas), the area around the station is surrounded by massive, beautiful parks with some of the most wonderful play spaces for children that I've ever encountered. Traveling together with my wife and 2-year-old daughter, this was absolutely incredible. 

For the 'grown ups,' the park provided a great space for relaxing, picnicking, and soaking up the Nordic summer rays. Peaceful and perfect. 

And the unit was lovely! Simple and organized with large windows and lots of natural light. A wonderful place to wake up in in the summer! The patio was perfect for summer, and my wife and I enjoyed a couple of relaxing meals outside at home. Kitchen was well-equipped and all worked perfectly. 

Our host, Ronny, despite being out-of-town during our visit, was very prompt and helpful in arranging keys, responding to inquiries, and helping assure that we had a comfortable experience. We would absolutely stay again if we have the opportunity to return to Stockholm. We fell in love with the city while we were there and the lodging arrangement went a long way to helping make our visit a special experience."

The flat itself is very tastefully and minimalistically decorated, with a large living room, nice kitchen and fully fitted restroom.

It was a huge plus to us that most of our activities were within a 5 to 30 minute walk. If you're not much of a walker, the metro is very close-by. 

Hugo was easy to communicate with, arranged for a smooth key drop-off nearby and left us a great list of tips (with a provided map!). We were also given access to his wi-fi, which made it a lot easier to plan our days using his apartment as a headquarters.

The surroundings are extremely beatiful with a huge park and the water just a few minutes away. There are smaller grocerystores near by, and else there is a huge store about 1-1,5 km away. If you like to be close to the center, it takes about 1 hour to walt to the city center. If you enjoy peace and quiet without being too far from the centre, then I highly recommmend this place.
The place is as in the pictures. A small but functional kitchen, a great living room with a balcony and a small bedroom. The bed it self was only 1 m wide, which was too close for comfort for us even though we are a couple - but when I looked at the pictures of the appartment, I also saw, that I should have known this before arriving. We managed, and had a great stay in Kristoffers appartment.

We met him in front of the house, in the flat he showed us around and gave us nice tips what to do and see in Stockholm. The flat is perfect when you stay in Stockholm, it takes only around 18 minutes from central station to the metro station near his place and then 5 minutes to walk (also it's very cheap to use the metro, we bought a ticket for 7 days for 320 SEK, around 35 €).

A tip for coming in/out of Arlanda airport--with the 24+ hour transportation tickets which cover zones ABC you just need a small supplement for getting in/out of the airport, and every 30 minutes there are trains that take you direct to the Sodra station, only 2 blocks from Jan's place.

The pictures on airbnb were nice, but the apartment was nicer. There is a well equipped kitchen, a large double bed and a pull out couch. As well as a very large bath, lots of closet space and very good heating.
It is located 2 blocks from 2 train lines and we had a chance to visit 4 very good coffee shops and bakeries within 3 blocks of the apartment. Our 3yo had such a great time that she has been asking to go back to Jan’s place several times a day.

The location is fantastic, super close to the metro and commuter rail and there are many restaurants and cafes nearby including the best coffeeshop in Stockholm, Drop Coffee (coming from a coffee snob!). The photos don't do justice to the flat itself, which is extremely spacious with a large living room, separate dining area, and good sized bedroom with closet space. The bathroom is also huge by Scandinavian standards, with a jacuzzi tub! It was very clean and comfortable, and Jan was extremely helpful in making sure we had everything we needed. He met us when we arrived (we had some trouble finding it initially -- beware that (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps will direct you to the wrong place!) and gave us great suggestions for exploring the neighborhood. We would love to stay here again and highly recommend it!"

The flat is spacious and well equipped for a short or long stay and although too rainy for us the balcony would be lovely in summer.

Its a quick walk to nearby shops and just a bit further to one of the nicer area's of Stockholm with all its bars/cafes and the ferry/bus stop to the other islands.

The apartment is beautiful, very clean, with high ceiling and hardwood floor, and guests stay in the master bedroom. Note, there is no elevator; it's just one floor upstairs. Also, there is no Internet, no Wi-Fi; so I bought a SIM card (see below). The location is central, with easy walking access to tourist destinations like Skansen, Vasa Museet, Gamla Stan, and shopping streets. Local tip: visit the Östermalms Saluhål next door to savor great delicacies. Regarding Internet, I went to 3butiken Stureplan in the neighborhood, and bought a 4G SIM card for 99 SEK that I put in my unlocked phone with tethering for my other devices, plus another 99 SEK for 5 Gb of data, with speeds up to 20 Mbps; they also sell 30 Gb of data for 299 SEK, and USB dongles. I used about 2 Gb in five days to work with the VPN, (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, upload lots of pictures on (Hidden by Airbnb) , and watch a couple of YouTube videos; I still have 3 Gb leftover.

The flat was definitely the upper end of our budget but still cheaper than a Stockholm hotel and much more comfortable. It was light, bright, roomy and well equipped. The bed was very comfortable and the building is quiet so we slept very well

Excellent location, opposite a rather picturesque church and graveyard. Near to trendy sofo and a nice leisurely walk away from the swimming area in Hornstull.

The apartment is located in Södermalm which is one of the most beautiful districts of Stockholm. The Old Town Gamla Stan can easily be reached by public transport, but also within walking distance (in about 20 min). Nena was very kind and helpful, she gaves us a lot of tips about cafes, restaurants. We definitely recommend!!"

She had stocked the fridge with some goodies and on the tables, some maps and brochures etc. with suggested places to eat and go (which were all fab).    The place is cozy and SUPER quiet -- but perfectly located for cool-hunting and hopping on ferries to Djurgarten and the like.  Only a 10-minute walk from the Fotografiska museum!  Thanks Nena!"

She was soo friendly on our arrival and told us everything we needed to know about the flat and the area. She even left maps and a list of places to eat/drink and visit during our holiday. She also offered us juice and food which we could use for breakfast throughout our stay - we love Nena!
The apartment was spotless and as lovely as it looks in the photos. It was very cosy(warm) aswell, which is always a bonus. Perfect for a couples trip to Stockholm.
The area, Sodermalm, is as described. Very trendy with loads of nice cafes/bars and restaurants. The shopping is very good too :) The flat was right next to bus stops, which were very frequent & easy to navigate to other parts of Stockholm, ie - Old town & Norrmalm etc. There are metro stations a 15minute walk in either direction, we used both as we discovered loads of nice things taking new routes.
We would definitely stay at Nena's again if traveling to Stockholm."

All communications with her and arrangements for collecting the keys were prompt and straightforward, and she made sure there were provisions for us in the kitchen when we arrived, as well as suggestions for places to eat, drink and visit, so we could start enjoying our break straightaway.
The flat is great - compact but very well designed. Great powerful shower too. The area is lovely - close to shops, cafes and restaurants and Fotografiska. It is possible to walk to the old town, but there is a bus stop very close.

In the middle of Sofo and very nice bars / restaurants in the neighborhood. But you don't hear anything about that in the apartment, it was very quiet. Nena was a good host, she had some tips for us. Also, she left us some breakfast (muesli, eggs, butter, juice). The WiFi in the studio was very good en accessible. 
The only thing that we found less comfortable, was the fact that the curtains were too short and too light and that the window in the kitchen had no curtains. We like to sleep in a very dark room and the lights of the other apartments made that we couldn't fall asleep at night. But with a good mask (we had 1) it wasn't a problem anymore."

He gave us very clear directions to get to his place from the airport, which was very helpful in a new city!  A lovely little apartment for a couple.  When it started getting too cold for us to walk around Stockholm as it got later in the evenings, my partner and I enjoyed sitting together listening to music by candlelight.  It was a perfect setting.

The apartment is also right by a metro station, so it's easy to get around with this apartment as a base.  Katya and I like to walk, so Sodermalm was a lovely area for this, and close enough to Gamla Stan and Norrmalm for us to be able to walk there and explore, always having the option of taking the metro if we wanted.

I've stayed 3 nights in his nice apartment. I arrived 2 hours late since the airport is a little far from city center. Sercan is patient and responsible to tell me the detailed route. He welcomed me with a big big smile that makes me feel so happy.  Then he help me a lot such as showing me the transportation to go outside as well as recommending best attractions in Stockholm.

The second night we chat a lot. I just traveled alone so I got a plenty of free time to be at the apartment. I mean Sercan is outgoing and we have so many common interests. It has been a long time that I haven't chat with someone in English in hours.

Sercan is also a good cook !!! It's my pleasure that he invited me to have dinner in third evening. He cooked risotto and I promise it is the most delicious one I ever tasted.

I feel so sorry about  the problem I made towards Sercan. After I returned the keys I just found that I forgot sth important in his apartment when he was in working !!! I just planned to  go to the company to take the keys. But he came back to the apartment within 1 hour and solved my mistake. I don't know how to appreciate him. He needn't to be so nice to a person just meet in 3 days, but ... Wow what I can tell is that I'm totally moved by Sercan.

I think what I get from this stay in Sercan's apartment cannot be described only by words, I hope there are more lucky \"Airbnbers\" choose his apartment. It is not only because how luxurious the apartment is , but about Sercan's attractive characters and his attitudes towards life.

The apartment looks exactly like the pictures on his profile: very clean, modern, and cosy. The bathroom and kitchen were highly practical and well sorted.

What first seemed like a rather \"long\" trip from the city center of Stockholm quickly changed into an experience that was well worth the journey, as it offered an insight in the everyday life outside the busy center of a country once ruled by vikings.

She managed to create very warm and welcoming atmosphere and I really enjoyed staying at her place. So my first airbnb experience was a great success and luck and I highly recommend this room if you plan to visit Stockholm.
The room is very nice, large and cozy. The house is situated very close to the city center and is located in a quite area near a small park. Perfect good night sleep is guaranteed, as there is no noise in the street at all. But if you plan to stay during the working week and prefer sleeping with an open window (as I do) - consider taking ear plugs with you, as the kindergarten is open from 8 till 9-10 AM and might be noisy:)"

The boat is kitted out with top spec equipment, and you can really tell a lot of effort has gone into making it feel incredibly cosy as well as looking fantastic.

In all honesty It was perfect for what we wanted. It was only double the price of the cheapest hostel we could find, and it was a million times better. I highly recommend it if a group of you are visiting Sweden.

It is less than a 10 minute walk from liljeholmen station, and you can be 'central' in 20 (ish) minutes.

I highly recommend staying here, it was a perfect base for an amazing weekend away.

We had drinks on the upper deck, thanks to plenty of fleeces and a gas fueled heater! Great base to stay, we must return to see the boat and Stockholm in summertime!"

As for the apartment, it's truly unique: she has been decorating it with taste with plenty of beautiful objects she brought from her trips and years spent travelling various parts the globe. The atmosphere is warm, cosy and colorful, and we loved feeling at home after coming back from long walks in Stockholm. The apartment has all the necessary equipments and there is always some nice object to look at. It's approximately 20-25 min walk from the city centre, in a calm, residential area. There's a small supermarket across the street and some cafés and restaurants nearby. Again, thank you  Jenny !"

She helped me with my doubts regarding transport, the city, things to do, places to visit or to go shopping. And not only she answered my questions, she also made very good suggestions that contributed to a perfect time in Stockholm. And we enjoyed very nice chats!
Her house is very well located and the surroundings are amazing for running or enjoying lovely walks. The house is clean and the room is very cosy. As a guest you have everything you need. Her son is also nice and the dog... so cute! It was my first time living with a dog and I had no problemas at all. The other way round, I will miss him :) 
I would strongly recommend to stay with Tiina. As for me, if I come back to Stockholm at some point, I will give her a call. If I were going to spend some days there, I would come back to her place. And if not, it would be great to enjoy a fika with her and catch up. She is a fabulous host!

Warm, cosy, and centrally located in a very safe neighbourhood - it has absolutely everything you could want or need.

The bed feels like sleeping on a cloud, the supermarket is right across the street and the metro is at your door (although we preferred to walk everywhere).

It was very cosy and was stocked with everything we could possibly need. One note, the ceiling in the loft is much lower than it appears in the listing.

The house is very clean, neat and well furnished. The rooms were cosy and there were enough sofas and couches + cushions to make u fall asleep the moment u sit. The location was great, as it's 10 mins to the supermarket and 4 mins to the tram station. Getting around was very easy with the tram and metro connections.

Hon fick också information om var i närheten det fanns en matbutik, vilket var värdefullt för oss. Det var väldigt tyst i grannskapet och lägenheten låg nära centrum med tanke på att det tog 10 minuter in till stan med tunnelbanan. Vidare så var lägenheten rymlig och det fanns tillräckligt med sängar för hela vårt resesällskap (6 personer!). Vi sov också bra och barnen hade tillräckligt med utrymme för att leka. Allting vi behövde fungerade också perfekt. Allt som allt känner vi oss helnöjda.

Elle nous a donné les informations de base sur le quartier (meilleur itinéraire vers le métro, commerces les plus proches) qui nous ont permis de nous organiser facilement le reste du séjour.

L'appartement est plutôt bien placé : pas au centre mais suffisamment proche pour y aller à pied en passant par le quartier de Norrmalm où il y a plein de magasins pour le shopping. L'appartement lui même est petit (comme indiqué dans l'annonce) mais fonctionnel. Il s'agit toutefois clairement d'une chambre d'étudiant dans une résidence étudiante avec ses inconvénients : petite douche sans charme et vue sur le périphérique nord de Stockholm qui est plutôt bruyant.

- The apartment was not clean, I would even say dirty and it was not very pleasant to stay there.
- There is much noise coming from the outside, even we had all windows closed, as it is close to the road. I don't know if it depends on the season, but it was rather cold there too, though the heater was on.
- Kitchen doesn't have any kettle.
- We arrived early in the morning, but it was possible to check in only after 6 pm, despite we had a friend in Stockholm who could meet the owner to receive the keys anytime.

Advantages:
- Close to the subway.
- The owner met us by the apartment and showed everything.

Please find hereunder our comments after our stay at Stefan's place :
We sent him a messagfe via Airbnb to confirm our arrival between 18h30 and 19h30. When we arrived at 18h30, he looked astonished to see us that ''ealry'' and was just starting to clean the flat. So we left the place and went out for a while. When we came back, we realized that the cleanlinees was very approximative. The carpet in the entry had a big spot, the coffee table in the living room full of glass and drink marks, some food was still stored in the fridge. The kitchen desk and the ceramic glass cooktops were rather dirty as well as the cabin plastic walls of the shower, the washbasin and the miror in the bathroom. The same with the wooden floor on which the vacuum cleaner seemed to have missed a lot of dust. We paid 56,00 euros for service and cleaning, which obviously were not justified.  
Being regular users of Airbnb, it is the first time that we have such a bad surprise. We strongly recommend Stefan to hire a real house maid to do the job in the future !..
Yours faithfully,
Claude and Laurence

The only drawback is the kitchen is extremely basic (toaster oven and two electric burners only) but apart from that this booking is highly recommended.
Short walk to T-bana and mall with everything you need, and on the other side massive open spaces."

Sofi och hennes pappa svarade snabbt och vänligt på mail och sms, och gjorde allt för att vår vistelse skulle bli så trevlig som möjligt, trots inställda tåg och storm. Alla instruktioner (teknik, nycklar, elektronik etc) var tydliga och lätta att följa och förstå.

Me and my family stayed 3 nights in this house, and we're really pleased with the experience. From the moment we stepped off the bus just outside the house (really - the bus stop is very close) until the moment we left we felt at home. It's a great house with plenty of space for a family of four (or more) and a very accommodating host that made us feel very welcome. The house is warm and cozy even when temperatures reach well below zero. 

Our host left everything prepared and we had no problems finding our way around the house. The kids loved the collection of toys in the house to the point where it left us with plenty of ideas for this year's X-mas. Just across the street from the house there is also a nice playground for the kids.

Finding the place was very easy, and even though someone at first might be scared off by the distance to the center of Stockholm everything felt very close once we got there. Metro within walking distance, bus just outside the house and plenty of stores nearby.

All in all we have nothing but positive experiences from our stay, and we can really recommend it to anyone looking for a good \"home base\" during their visit to the beautiful city of Stockholm.

Les photos correspondent bien au lieu, un soin particulier avait été porté sur la propreté et le rangement. L’appartement est très lumineux, beaucoup de rangement sont laissés vacants pour permettre aux voyageurs de se sentir chez eux le temps d'un WE.
Même si nous n'avons pas rencontré directement Ebba, elle a été très disponible et nous avons beaucoup échangé par téléphone pour rendre notre séjour très agréable.
Un supermarché est au coin de la rue et vous permet de faire vos courses si besoin, mais il existe aussi beaucoup de restaurant et café tout au long de Birger Jarlsgatan, une des rues qui mène au centre.
La station de métro est effectivement très proche mais comme les transports en commun sont assez cher vous pouvez aussi marcher jusqu'au centre ville (20min env). Stockholm est vraiment une ville à taille humaine et tout se fait assez rapidement.
En résumé, ceci est un bon plan, bien situé, et à un prix raisonnable!"

The location in Stockholm's Soder is wonderful. It is on a quiet street but two minutes from a main street and a subway station- so it is very convenient to travel to all parts of the city and close to shops and restaurants. 
The flat itself was clean, cosy and well equipped.
Ann was very helpful and nice.
I recommend it highly."

"9393",9402519,55823995,2015-12-06,2092557,"Marine","Jose was very friendly and communication was very easy with him before and at al times during the stay. He also was flexible in the arrival time, which is nice.
The apartment itself is tiny but accomodated with anything you could need for a short stay (kitchen, heated floor bathroom, comfortable bed. It is not big for sure, but really as depicted on the pictures, spotlessly clean and convenient.
But the very best part is of course the location. You could not find a better location in Stockhoml, right in the middle of Gamla Stan, a few meters away from the night life, shopping streets and restaurants of the old center. We loved being in such a central area, and we do not regret our choice of staying in Jose's flat."

He also made recommendations of things in the area! The place is a bit small, but worked perfectly for 3 college students (and would be perfect for a couple). The location is amazing though! Very central with a grocery store right outside. Great experience!"

As soon as you enter the apartment had a weird and unpleasant smell.The wash basin had water logging problem. 
Generally, it would have been nice if the apartment was clean and tidy.

The second is the location. Even that the Vasa museum is located on a different island it takes only 40-50 minutes to walk there. But many other things such as a Dr.Martens store, the Under Bron club,  public pools Eriksdalsbadet, the pub Pelican, vegan or vegetarian restaurants are just 5-10 minutes away from this charming apartment.

On our first night, Hakan picked us up on the metro station and showed the way to his flat, which is just 7-10 minutes from the station. He then gave us an orientation as to where we can buy groceries and places where we can hang out. This place is very recommendable for small families and group of friends who are tired of the usual noisy hostels. Plus the internet is very fast."
